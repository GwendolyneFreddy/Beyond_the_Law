# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = This mod lights up the unusual relationship between two people who cannot be more differently: Kova, a magician/thief with an unsavory background and a good heart, and Kiyone, a law-enforcing archer. The mod points out more about the power play between the Shadow Thieves and the Cowled Wizards in Athkatla, and why certain things happened to certain NPCs. Kova and Kiyone appear only if the player is either good or neutrally aligned and the reputation of the player is more than 12. (ToB, BGT, BG2:EE, EET)
