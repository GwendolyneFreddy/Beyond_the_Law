@0    = ~I died, but something... some force, drew me back to you, to this place. I had thought there would be relief, but this is quite an unexpected complication.~
@1    = ~It seems you are not alone in that experience. You have a rather magnetic personality, <CHARNAME>. Seems that my soul would rather follow you to hell than head off on its own, but maybe it was bound here anyway.~
@2    = ~Even to the end you are unrepentant. You better hope you will find mercy wherever you are going, because you will not find it here.~
@3    = ~Apparently you are incapable of learning from past experiences, that even now, you are outmatched, outwitted, outnumbered. Come - justice awaits.~
@4    = ~Nor do we, really. Come now - justice must be served.~
@5    = ~If you had no doubts about facing us, we would have found you more easily and eager to fight us than this. Your bluff will be called for what it is.~
@6    = ~A great crime, and a greater punishment. Is the way of all justice, I wonder, even among His children?~
@7    = ~Not always. There are crimes too great for any mere sentence to be fitting.~
@8    = ~So, this is the elven city of fable. It is a pity it could not be happier times that brings us to this ancient home of my father's people.~
@9    = ~I never once thought I would look upon this place, where my mother stepped in the days of her youth. If only it was not stained with the blood of those who might once have known her.~
@10   = ~They looked shaken but all right when we saw them at the city gates. Hurry there - you might be able to find them before they are moved to safety.~
@11   = ~They'll be all right, my child. I'm sure of it...~
@12   = ~Those poor children... we will make Irenicus return this debt of pain yet!~
@13   = ~There might yet be a chance they'll find their parents again, Kiyone.~
@14   = ~They're dead, Kova. You heard them speak of those noises.~
@15   = ~Children imagine noises in crises. Besides, even if they are dead perhaps they can be resurrected.~
@16   = ~You can save your pretty words for those kids when we meet them again.~
@17   = ~Oh no, not a dragon...~
@18   = ~Well I guess we have little choice if we want the Goblet. Perhaps if we offered it enough to make it worth its while...~
@19   = ~I say we slay it for the evil it has wrought in this place! Pity we have no advantage of surprise against it...~
@20   = ~How sad. Perhaps if it was another that he had cleaved closer to... but no, he made his own choice, I'm sure. Powerful are the words of a one held close.~
@21   = ~A gross mistake, at least in retrospect. Mercy is a privilege to be given out only to those capable of learning from it, rather than to be given out for its own sake.~
@22   = ~I cannot stand idly by and watch my mother's people meet grief at your hands, <CHARNAME>. I apologise that I am so outwardly forgetful of what you have done for me, but I can do no other.~
@23   = ~I do not know why you turn to such evil at such a juncture as this, but my misjudgment of your person will have to be paid for in blood - either yours, or mine.~
@24   = ~Let us make haste - there are many lives at stake here.~
@25   = ~And that of our own, as well. The longer we take, the more the odds will stack against us, I suspect.~
@26   = ~He seeks to become a God? No wonder his interest in your person, <CHARNAME>...~
@27   = ~I wonder if that is how many of the Gods before him came to be - by seeking to become one?~
@28   = ~Kova and Kiyone - as unlikely a pair of companions as any of the rest, with an even more unlikely relationship between them, one that is somehow close and honest, yet full of tension and uncertainty.~
@29   = ~What is certain, though, is that they need not fight this fight, especially now that their case is closed and they might even have found in each other someone who might understand themselves.~
@30   = ~Kova, Kiyone, you are both good and able companions, but now that your case is settled, there's no need to risk losing one another in my fight.~
@31   = ~Kova, Kiyone, you are both good and able companions, but now that your case is settled, there's no need to risk losing your lives in my fight.~
@32   = ~You are both aware of the strength and power Irenicus has at his disposal, and we could well be wiped out. There's no need to endanger yourselves for my sake.~
@33   = ~Before we continue, I need to know that the two of you will stand by me through the difficult ordeal that surely awaits us.~
@34   = ~Much as I value my friendship with Kova, we would probably not have become friends if not for you. To abandon you now in your time of need is beyond my capability to perform.~
@35   = ~If I have finally found a good friend in my life, it is because I have known her to be one in my time with you, <CHARNAME>. And so I too, will stand with you against what is to come.~
@36   = ~Your life has been risked for me many a time - should I now shirk from giving back unto you what you have freely given to me? I think not.~
@37   = ~Perhaps I am not the cowardly thief I once was, and I will follow you onward, <CHARNAME>. To do what is right and to return in part what I owe you for your part in saving me.~
@38   = ~Yet you have endangered yourself plenty of times for my sake, and it would be wrong for me to do less for you.~
@39   = ~That I even have a life now, to risk for your sake, is because of what you have risked for me. And though I am fearful, I willingly give what you have given me, back to you.~
@40   = ~As you have stood by us through even more trials and testings, I shall certainly stand by you and lend what strength I have to your cause.~
@41   = ~There may be others to whom I owe nothing, but to you I owe a great deal, and though I am fearful I will stand with you to face your coming trial. ~
@42   = ~This is their duty <CHARNAME>, not ours. We are not obligated to help them, especially if we have better things to do.~
@43   = ~Still, if it means that a great evil will be loosed upon the world, then we must do what we can. If not for these helpless knights, then for the sake of goodness upon the world.~
@44   = ~So we are to bring slippers for the old man if we are to seek him? Oh well, a little more kindness in this world shouldn't be too much of a bad thing.~
@45   = ~That large statue gives me a sense of unease, and there is the tingle of hostility in the air. Some care would not be amiss in this place.~
@46   = ~This is not good... might we, by some good fortune, have those slippers ready, <CHARNAME>?~
@47   = ~This is not good... perhaps it would have been a good idea to have brought those slippers after all.~
@48   = ~Suicidal fanatics? I wonder what the demon means by that...~
@49   = ~I do not trust this thing to keep its end of the bargain. Perhaps there is another way, and if so we should do well to find it first.~
@50   = ~How sad that someone should be reduced to such a pitiful state. I wonder how he was like before he became mad. Perhaps there will be something we can do to restore him.~
@51   = ~Imagining how his experiences must have been makes my short time in the guild when other Shadow Thieves wanted to knife me seem like a walk in the park in comparison.~
@52   = ~That is an unexpectedly useful. This conversation has proven more advantageous than I would have thought it to be initially.~
@53   = ~Yes, he does seem rather lucid for a mad person. He might not be far off from being restored, if only we could find a way.~
@54   = ~Yes, he certainly has returned to his senses after all. It is good to see that spark return to his eye.~
@55   = ~I see he has regained his senses and is himself once more. This is a fine development indeed, and I am glad that he is well again.~
@56   = ~Stay your hand, Tamorlin. <CHARNAME> here has an odd sense of humour at times, but we would not heal you only to kill you. You are free to return to your loved ones as you wish.~
@57   = ~Come now, <CHARNAME>, that was a rather bad timing for that sort of jest. Anyway, Tamorlin, it just a misunderstanding, I'm sure we didn't heal you only to kill you. You are free to go where you like, and we wish you well.~
@58   = ~We may as well agree to help, it will save us trouble now, and even the task itself only involves destroying that which is evil.~
@59   = ~It seems he genuinely has no intention to do battle, <CHARNAME>. Some civility for now shouldn't hurt - we can always change our tone later if necessary.~
@60   = ~Caution should be exercised here. If we don't have to, I think there is no need to risk ourselves in this meaningless gambling competition. Let us just win the gem and move on out of here.~
@61   = ~How can we be sure that if we hand the way over that he will return it? How will he even be able to return to us? Perhaps it would be better not to risk handing it over.~
@62   = ~I do get the impression Aesgareth is sincere, but whether he can return it to us in here when he is free is a question probably none of us know. Whether we undertake that risk will be up to <CHARNAME>.~
@63   = ~Such bitterness and hate, and now he is dead. Perhaps he might have been less bitter if we could have salved his pain, but it is too late for that.~
@64   = ~He is probably happier where he is now, though. Finding peace again after all the years of fleeing and surviving - it must have been a welcome reprieve.~
@65   = ~Would that it be as you say, Kiyone.~
@66   = ~Ah, that's quite a relief that it did not turn on us! Still, that dragon did seem oddly unaggressive and pliable to flattery.~
@67   = ~Indeed, perhaps with better words we may be able to obtain information from him about this dungeon and level, especially about Carston.~
@68   = ~He seems pitiful, but he was also responsible for so much death and suffering. Do with him as you see fit, <CHARNAME>.~
@69   = ~I doubt any mortal machinations brought forth this apparition, <CHARNAME>. Let us at least listen, and from there make a more informed decision.~
@70   = ~If all that is true, then we cannot stand idly by and watch. It seems that Odren will have to die for his deception. No more than he deserves perhaps...~
@71   = ~Reading this scroll would be the simplest and best route, I think. But that is of course, only if we assume what we have been told to be true.~
@72   = ~Still lying through your teeth with false bravado? You have fled so many times and even shattered passages to prevent us from reaching you.~
@73   = ~How poorly you know me, but you shall know me better when I quench my thirst in your blood.~
@74   = ~Good then, that you will fight hard. It is only when up against a beast like you that we can see what mettle we are made of.~
@75   = ~Be wary now - a beast is the more dangerous when cornered.~
@76   = ~I think your concern about our pursuit is more to stave off your own end.~
@77   = ~You poor fool, do you think your friends here are forever going to keep you from the wrath of those who hunt you? But that doesn't matter, since you will find that I am a better hunter than any of them.~
@78   = ~I never thought I'd speak up for a Shadowmaster, <CHARNAME>, but I feel it was in part my own fault for failing to forestall Saemon's treachery, despite suspecting it.~
@79   = ~How unexpected. Perhaps we could charge him a good fifteen thousand gold pieces for helping him with this little problem, <CHARNAME>. It would only be fair.~
@80   = ~Though I am loathe to trust them, I see little reason why they wouldn't stick to their side of the bargain, and should turn out well.~
@81   = ~We don't need help from these thieves anyway, who couldn't even help themselves earlier. Let us begone and not waste more time here.~
@82   = ~I might have guessed it would turn out so, but not having the swordarms of the paladins on our side make things that much more difficult.~
@83   = ~I didn't think you thought well enough of the Order to want them to join us on this.~
@84   = ~Circumstances change, and whatever might tip the scales in our favour would be well.~
@85   = ~This gets interesting indeed, and it is good the odds are slowly turning in our favour.~
@86   = ~Who would have thought I'd be serving alongside the knights? It is an interesting twist, though not altogether disagreeable.~
@87   = ~I will not lift my hand against one so righteous as this, and if this is the evil you show him, you deserve whatever comes your way. On guard, <CHARNAME>!~
@88   = ~The deeds of this dark elf has visited my ears before, and it is plain who is in the right and wrong. Though I regret it has come to this, I will not tolerate your bloodthirstiness further.~
@89   = ~This is a fair <DAYNIGHT>, to meet one so strong in truth and deeds, and to be able to fight alongside his blades. I look forward eagerly to that coming battle.~
@90   = ~Unlike you, I can't say I ever really look forward to a battle, but if we have to face this vampire, knowing that we have Drizzt Do'Urden backing us is a considerable relief.~
@91   = ~I think facing a brood of vampires led by one recently enriched by the soul of a God is not too small an errand to seek help with, <CHARNAME>, and there are probably few allies as effective as this drow warrior and his company.~
@92   = ~The legendary elven city of Suldanessellar, gone? If that is so, then it'd be interesting to see how we'd fare against Irenicus himself.~
@93   = ~That is so, but is this is the way of the people of Rillifane, to leave us to face the dire evil that they will not, have others risk their lives for your sakes?~
@94   = ~I thought you can barely remember the names of any Gods...~
@95   = ~How do you know the name of our God, the giver of truth and life?~
@96   = ~I do not know much, except that leaving us to this task unaided is unseemly of those who claim to be His people.~
@97   = ~His tone does not bode well for us, <CHARNAME>.~
@98   = ~Though our circumstances are dark, it is good to have some potential allies, if they manage to remain alive.~
@99   = ~Any development that gives us the hope of being free is a good one. Attempts at treachery can be dealt with after we are out of this place.~
@100  = ~What has this person done to you, that you consign him to death in so foul a place? This is act that you have taken is an act of evil that I will not forget.~
@101  = ~This cold-blooded murder will not be forgotten, <CHARNAME>. Justice will catch up with you some day.~
@102  = ~We must kill the illithid brain before it overwhelms us with its guardians!~
@103  = ~It seems they are ready to do battle to regain the sword. Returning it might be wise - it hardly does us any good, unusable as it is.~
@104  = ~You dare to stop us? Very well, you can answer for it when the elves' mustering of their strength come upon our forces.~
@105  = ~We will not be swayed from our resolve to do battle against the accursed elves, and are willing to see to it that you are well compensated for letting us do so.~
@106  = ~Yes, of course it would have been far bloodier than all that we've gone through to obtain your eggs. Your kindness is reminiscent of that in some recent place we visited.~
@107  = ~You dare presume to judge me, in my own lair?~
@108  = ~My apologies, my lady. This member of our company is weary of the bloodthirsty intrigue among the drow, and is too tired to think straight.~
@109  = ~I shall be generous and let this insult pass, for the service you have done for me. In the meantime, test my patience no further.~
@110  = ~This thing is only worth anything if we attempt to take on an ancient lich, even the founder of this city, who predates even a dragon! Even if this merchant can be trusted, such risks are needless.~
@111  = ~That is the exact purpose of this rope, to remove the risks involved. Think of what he has hoarded over the centuries - the price I ask is mere pittance compared to what is to be gained.~
@112  = ~It always comes down to this, doesn't it? I knew we shouldn't have trusted the merchant enough to take the rope.~
@113  = ~This is no mere errand we have been sent upon, and I am starting to wonder if killing one of these creatures would be easier than trying to find the eggs as soon as possible and risking drow wrath.~
@114  = ~Still, if we must, I'd think taking on the Kuo-Toans should be the easiest. The idea of meeting more mind-flayers fills me with dread.~
@115  = ~Now, this is the time for us to strike and reclaim the eggs!~
@116  = ~A respite would be welcome, but in here it is more likely to risk us being exposed. It might be best that we pass time in the Underdark itself rather than spend more time in this foul city.~
@117  = ~The intrigue between these two is promising and could create opportunities for us to do what we have to. I think it would not be amiss to watch them closely.~
@118  = ~They must have offended us in some great way, and it would be well to know what they did that we may visit wrath upon them to the fullest measure that they deserve.~
@119  = ~You have an interesting way of questioning the motives of the Matron Mothers.~
@120  = ~I only look forward to dealing with the deep gnomes as they deserve, in accordance with the wishes of the Matron Mothers.~
@121  = ~It might be useful to pit Solaufein against Phaere, we may yet make the best of things and see what advantage can be had out of all this conniving. If bloodshed can be avoided, so much the better as well.~
@122  = ~This is a surprise, <CHARNAME>. I had thought the desire she would provoke and the absence of choice would have surely meant you spending a good amount of time in there.~
@123  = ~I suppose your action was expected, though I had thought you above such primal lusts. Either that or you had no choice.~
@124  = ~Even if there was no choice, it must be a rare chance to be able to experience a drow so up close and personal, and a difficult one to pass up.~
@125  = ~The thought of being close to a male does not appeal to me, but maybe if I were male instead I would do so. Even if it provided no insights in the enemy, I understand it would be pleasurable.~
@126  = ~I for one, would not.~
@127  = ~Then either I have overestimated the power of male lust, or you lack in libido.~
@128  = ~I wonder if all males would done as you have, <CHARNAME>, given the chance.~
@129  = ~True, I suppose. It must be difficult to resist such dark beauty.~
@130  = ~If it is a close examination of the female drow that you want, as <CHARNAME>'s experience has shown, I'm sure our guises would not fail under scrutiny.~
@131  = ~True, but these guises do not lend any of us the practiced erotic skill of a drow.~
@132  = ~And I think some of us don't even know the basics.~
@133  = ~Not so fast, drow. Give us the eggs, now, and see to it we leave this accursed city safely.~
@134  = ~It is better to be subservient and bide our time for a good opportunity, than pay for any trespass with our own blood. Let us tread carefully.~
@135  = ~Now that he is out of the way, we might be able to get proof of the deed without needless bloodshed.~
@136  = ~That is at once horrifying and sad, yet that which most disturbs me is that I almost envy her. But no, that couldn't have made too much sense...~
@137  = ~It makes all the sense in the world, at least to me.~
@138  = ~I was afraid you would say that, but with some control the situation will eventually resolve itself. Enough of distractions, let us return to the task at hand.~
@139  = ~It would normally be foolishness to leave one alive who has found out about us, but Solaufein seems different from other drow. Let us hope we have made the right choice.~
@140  = ~A most excellent and timely development. Now we can hold on to the real eggs without fear of being exposed.~
@141  = ~Why are we doing this when Solaufein has departed? This violence is needless!~
@142  = ~It seems you are as bloodthirsty as many of those I have known in my time among cut-throats, and I will remember how blood has been shed this day, in vain.~
@143  = ~A satisfactory conclusion, though it could have been handled better.~
@144  = ~A much preferable outcome to spilling blood. I'm glad things turned out this way.~
@145  = ~Those are not all our choices. I suggest you rethink your approach, fish.~
@146  = ~Fish? Perhaps I have not made my thoughts clear.~
@147  = ~I have outlined the threat I intend. I do not bluff. Fear me.~
@148  = ~Perhaps we should, but it is difficult to kill a drow priestess from your tank. Keeping your murderous intent secret is far easier, at least up until the point it was shared with us.~
@149  = ~Yet another worthless errand to risk our necks for, and with little choice except to obey or be hunted down.~
@150  = ~Now I know why some have a taste for killing. It is tempting to accept that this creature should be done away with simply for being who she is.~
@151  = ~Are not all drow our enemies? Is there really a need to question if a beholder or mindflayer should be slain?~
@152  = ~Perhaps. I question your purpose in testing me so.~
@153  = ~Astute, but I think your question will have to remain unanswered.~
@154  = ~Are you all right? We have to keep our cool for this.~
@155  = ~I'm fine, there's nothing that can be done for her in here anyway.~
@156  = ~Let us steel ourselves - there'll probably be worse things we will see, and which we will have to let slide, repulsive as they might be.~
@157  = ~I should have guessed that you were more than just an ordinary being. Your magnificence only amplifies your potency, and we should not dare to cross you or your charge.~
@158  = ~I strongly advocate discretion, although I get the impression we have little choice except to take on what this dragon will not face.~
@159  = ~Well, at least that might improves our chances, somewhat.~
@160  = ~I've always wondered what it would be like to examine a drow up close and personal. To enter the being and form of the enemy should prove a novel experience.~
@161  = ~It seems we have little choice, though it is a privilege to serve. We promise our best, though I doubt you'd accept anything less than success.~
@162  = ~I think coming back was a really bad idea on your part, <CHARNAME>.~
@163  = ~I think now would be a good time to get ourselves ready for whatever lies beyond.~
@164  = ~We are willing to listen, though our willingness to do more would depend on the nature of the task at hand.~
@165  = ~We can take it as encouragement to know that even here in Underdark, we can do some good and bring some comfort to those around us.~
@166  = ~And equally refreshing that they are grateful. Perhaps so little kindness is known here that some of those here know better than to receive it with treachery.~
@167  = ~You know, we really ought to reconsider toying around with more of these facets. There is a high chance that whatever was trapped in there was put there for a reason.~
@168  = ~If drow did this, then one or two of them might not deserve to be trapped inside, and it would be best if we could free them from such a fate.~
@169  = ~I suppose that would be true, assuming the ordeal hasn't affected their capacity for thinking straight.~
@170  = ~Exploring other dimensions, gaining treasure therein... it sounds interesting, but dangerous.~
@171  = ~If this were a place other than the Underdark, perhaps it would be reasonable to aid him, but for now I think it best that we focus on leaving this place rather than be distracted with his concerns.~
@172  = ~I am beginning to have doubts about this adventure, but I will stand by your decision, <CHARNAME>.~
@173  = ~I think our portion is more than sufficient already, <CHARNAME>. Never would I have thought to find such fairness in this forsaken part of the world, so let us depart from this man in peace.~
@174  = ~This mage treated us fairly, yet we came to blows and he now lies dead because of your greed. I wonder why you agreed to help me in the first place, even.~
@175  = ~If not for the time we have spent travelling together, this alone would be enough to cause me to leave immediately.~
@176  = ~This mage was murdered in cold blood for the sake of greed. I will stay in your company for now, but I will keep company no further with you if such things continue.~
@177  = ~It is good to know we have not lost their trail, and will catch up with them yet.~
@178  = ~I think it only gives us more reason to get out of here as soon as possible. We can always try to take them on when we're not in such hostile territory.~
@179  = ~Either way, it suits us well to know where they've been.~
@180  = ~The expanse of the Underdark, wide and wild. Such endearing darkness teeming with hospitable inhabitants.~
@181  = ~Encouragement is what we will need to get through this place. Not sarcasm.~
@182  = ~If you have nothing good to say, keep your thoughts to yourself.~
@183  = ~Can't you ever say something that is positive?~
@184  = ~My apologies, my lady. I was just trying to keep the situation in perspective.~
@185  = ~You know, I'm starting to suspect that following you was a really bad idea, <CHARNAME>, but now wouldn't be a good time to pull out.~
@186  = ~So all that is left to do is simply for us to get out of here, alive.~
@187  = ~I'm sure we will. We have a trial to attend to, namely, yours.~
@188  = ~Remind me to try giving the drow and various other beasts around here that reason so that they'll leave us alone.~
@189  = ~We've other means of persuasion at our disposal. In any case, I've promised Bylanna that I will bear responsibility for your case, and that includes your person.~
@190  = ~You are such a comfort to have around, you know that?~
@191  = ~Of course.~
@192  = ~Now let's get moving, I'm starting to hate this place.~
@193  = ~I've read that this place is infested with the ravenous shark-people... if we are to leave here alive, it might be best to co-operate for as long as they remain civil, though that might not be for long.~
@194  = ~It seems belief in gods are useful after all for something, and I am grateful to be found in your company, <CHARNAME>, as opposed to being served up as some delicacy for fish.~
@195  = ~I think some diplomacy would not be uncalled for, <CHARNAME>.~
@196  = ~I am starting to take an exceptional distaste to that particular fish.~
@197  = ~This beast here is no more fitting to be a judge than any power-mad lunatic. Let us be on our guard.~
@198  = ~Pleasant words, but if his treatment of the priestesses is anything to go by, they would probably change at the drop of a hat.~
@199  = ~<CHARNAME>, if the denizens of the Underdark were to destroy this place, the coasts would be free from Sahuagin raids for a long time to come, for they cannot pass through the seas.~
@200  = ~Just something to think about before agreeing to anything.~
@201  = ~Now that we've agreed to this, I suppose we ought to keep our word, though I do not wish to see this race made stronger.~
@202  = ~On another note, this might allow us to pass through on our way out of this place with less violence, though I do not relish going to where our path seems to taking us.~
@203  = ~That doesn't sound too bad, so long as playing the game doesn't mean facing other "nasty nasty nasties."~
@204  = ~Interesting. Did he mention anything about the contents of the chest? Maybe he just meant the chest itself.~
@205  = ~Really now, nothing in the letter of your instructions prevents you from opening the chest without us ever touching it, and we'd be able to access the contents without ever disturbing the chest itself.~
@206  = ~That sure sounds like an interesting and distinctly meaningful task, assuming you choose to remain here, of course.~
@207  = ~This prince does not inspire me to much confidence, but at least he's not intent on having us killed.~
@208  = ~You certainly seem a better ruler than the king we met not so long ago, but your people's gain will eventually mean more raids along the coasts.~
@209  = ~Since when did more raids along the coasts, maybe in a few years' time, mean anything to you, Kova? Or maybe they do.~
@210  = ~Still, we might be able to come to terms if what you can offer us something substantial.~
@211  = ~This is quite a pleasant surprise. It seems even shark people such as these can be generous.~
@212  = ~It is a pleasant surprise to see this king honor his word. Our gain is very probably the loss of the Sahuagin, but that might really be for the best for all of us.~
@213  = ~Jaheira, this might not be the best time to be arguing about the meaning of a word.~
@214  = ~This does not bode well for Jaheira at all. If we don't act quickly I believe she will be meeting Belgrade soon.~
@215  = ~We have to act quickly, or I fear Jaheira will be joining her dead friend.~
@216  = ~At least we have a place to investigate. Let us make haste, or I fear you might be meeting your dead friend soon.~
@217  = ~I know well enough what to do... and I will not let Belgrade go unavenged.~
@218  = ~Good riddance to bad rubbish. This is a fate long overdue, a justice finally served.~
@219  = ~Just enemies that could have been more conclusively dealt with.~
@220  = ~Thank you for that reminding me that if it weren't for the interference of the law, this would not have happened and Belgrade would still be alive.~
@221  = ~I hope so as well, on both counts.~
@222  = ~You know, I'd almost rather we'd meet more of his kind than be assured that we will always be faced with enemies.~
@223  = ~And I'd rather you not interrupt me when I'm speaking to <CHARNAME>.~
@224  = ~I don't like the sound of this, <CHARNAME>.~
@225  = ~You know, I really think we should be going. You don't have to answer this, <CHARNAME>.~
@226  = ~Who would have thought? I'm fighting Harpers today.. and giving no quarter.~
@227  = ~But no one is perfect, and certainly no one is above corruption. Either way, it seems my path is set, and I stand on righteousness and truth.~
@228  = ~This is a sorry day. Fighting Harpers, of all people... but I have little choice. The Vigilantes back among the Sentinels will not be pleased.~
@229  = ~It is a relief to know there will be no further violence this day. Enough Harper blood has already been spilt, even though their judgment was born of a corrupt desire for power.~
@230  = ~I've always thought the Harpers meddlesome, untrustworthy allies at best, for your cause.~
@231  = ~Still, they are allies nonetheless, and I would not wish to cause the Vigilantes back at home undue difficulties with them.~
@232  = ~That sounds like something an assassin acquaintance once told me. If I had heeded him, I would by now be waist deep in the blood of others, for little more than the approval of others.~
@233  = ~Do not listen to him, that is a lie from the pit. Peer approval does not dictate what right and wrong is.~
@234  = ~What do you intend to do now that you are no longer a Harper, Jaheira?~
@235  = ~I do not know. I... I trust Silvanus will guide me.~
@236  = ~Do not worry, Jaheira. Once this whole matter is over, I might be able to find you a place among the Sentinels. We could do well with one like you, and many of our rangers may benefit from what you know of nature.~
@237  = ~I do not think they would accept me if it meant trouble with the Harpers.~
@238  = ~Perhaps there might not be. Or there might not be enough for them to be concerned.~
@239  = ~Besides, you did what was right. Do not doubt that, even though things may appear otherwise to people.~
@240  = ~Life is not a fairytale simply because you do the right thing. Bad things happen... and to good people.~
@241  = ~That much has always been plain to me. But there will be evidence regarding the misdeeds of Galvarey and his cohorts - there always is.~
@242  = ~If the true Harpers cannot uncover it, once my case is resolved and <CHARNAME>'s cause is served, I will investigate the matter myself, and you shall have what is your due.~
@243  = ~Your confidence in your own abilities is admirable, Kiyone. A little too admirable, maybe.~
@244  = ~I know who I am, and what I am capable of. I just need time and some assistance here and there. Meantime, would you consider joining the Sentinels if the Harpers don't want you back?~
@245  = ~I will think on it, but the answer is likely no. I can pretend to be something I'm not, but I won't. And what I was, perhaps I still am, even if others say otherwise.~
@246  = ~Well spoken, and I respect you for that. Still, my offer is open for the taking anytime, Jaheira.~
@247  = ~My thanks. I appreciate your gesture.~
@248  = ~Congratulations, Jaheira. I am happy for you.~
@249  = ~My thanks. This has eased many a burden and pain for me.~
@250  = ~Indeed, and it is good to see you happier again.~
@251  = ~It's a slight pity, though. You would have made a fine Sentinel.~
@252  = ~I wasn't aware I had been made such an offer.~
@253  = ~Honestly, I probably would have made the offer. It was just a matter of time.~
@254  = ~I appreciate the mention, though I'm sure you'll understand if I'll not be accepting it.~
@255  = ~That I can understand, very well.~
@256  = ~I don't trust this pirate, but risking his treachery would be preferable to entering that dark place.~
@257  = ~Agreed, I think only one tired of life would consider the Underdark as an option when we have our friendly pirate city to adjourn to.~
@258  = ~It would be best to pay him heed, <CHARNAME>. What I know of the Underdark only impresses it as a place to be avoided at all costs.~
@259  = ~And what about the villainy that we have been subject to, that we have been lied to repeatedly and made use of time and again? Your cunning, pirate, is well and truly above that of many.~
@260  = ~Your compliment is ill-timed, my lady. Perhaps if our situation were more favourable, we might be able to drink to that together.~
@261  = ~If the Underdark weren't so treacherous, I'd say we drop this conniving scum and take that route instead. At least over there the threat will be plain from without than hidden from within.~
@262  = ~Be wary, <CHARNAME>, for this crook now no longer has any need for us.~
@263  = ~At least once we get out to sea, we will no longer have need for him.~
@264  = ~I think we're in quite a spot of trouble. Perhaps it wouldn't be too late to return to Saemon whatever he has given to us?~
@265  = ~Now might be a good time for us to stand back a little and let these inmates take the brunt of his power.~
@266  = ~At least the main threat is concluded, though it is a pity we could not put an end to this foul mage. As for these assassins, spotting them before they strike should make them less of a threat.~
@267  = ~Despite my doubts as to his motivations, there is truth in his words.~
@268  = ~Erring on the side of caution is indeed preferable. Although whose side he is truly on is still a good question.~
@269  = ~We can bide our time, so let us first handle Irenicus, and then pay him back at an opportune moment.~
@270  = ~Yes, we're finally free and out that accursed maze!~
@271  = ~Now, to deal with Irenicus.~
@272  = ~I was afraid you'd say that, but I suppose we have hardly any other choice.~
@273  = ~What in the name of the Gods was that!?~
@274  = ~I don't know, but we had best be prepared to deal with it if it should show up again. I hope for all our sakes that you continue to remain yourself, <CHARNAME>.~
@275  = ~Something seems to be wrong with you, <CHARNAME>. If you're not quite yourself rest might be in order before we proceed onwards. After all, recent developments couldn't have been easy for you.~
@276  = ~I don't think it's as simple as just the events. Something feels different, but I could be wrong. Still, rest is probably a good idea, if we have to.~
@277  = ~Right on schedule, as expected. Let's finish her here, <CHARNAME>!~
@278  = ~As expected, I suppose. Still, we cannot let her stop us now, not when we're so close to being free of this place.~
@279  = ~A pity this one seems impossible to reason with, for it seems we have at least foe in common. It's too bad we'll probably come to blows.~
@280  = ~It is some relief to know that we have salved the pain and anguish that had been, even if it was for a vampire.~
@281  = ~It seems even such creatures of darkness might have grievances beyond their apparent evil.~
@282  = ~Well, if even vampires cannot be certainly evil, who else would there be, who would be guilty enough for outright condemnation?~
@283  = ~I see your point, and I will think on it.~
@284  = ~I trust this is not too strange a request, for I have with me the heart of man, someone I once thought of as a friend.~
@285  = ~It seems that you expect us to try to guide one who has already fallen, but that is not new to us. Some live well and then fall unexpectedly. Tell me of this man.~
@286  = ~His name was Yoshimo, and his hand was forced against us, at least so I would like to believe. While this won't bring him back, I hope that it will serve some purpose, somehow.~
@287  = ~It is done. Be laid to rest where you deserve, wherever that may be.~
@288  = ~Farewell, my friend.~
@289  = ~And so, Yoshimo is dead now. Things are as they should be, aren't they?~
@290  = ~He was a friend, after all, once. Though really, I don't think he's worth being upset over.~
@291  = ~Perhaps so, or perhaps not. It is all probably meaningless, but it shouldn't hurt to see what we can do for him.~
@292  = ~Even to the end, I admire your courage in the face of death, a courage which I suspect is beyond me.~
@293  = ~This is no better of yours, Kova. Let us send this wretched traitor to where he belongs!~
@294  = ~Yes, and you cannot change where I am going. Now, let's get this over with!~
@295  = ~And it seems today we cross blades, just as we have mentioned before. No hard feelings?~
@296  = ~They never have been, and never will be.~
@297  = ~This is not the time for sympathies, <CHARNAME>. Do not let him lower your guard!~
@298  = ~A Geas. I see now, I guess. It is too late, isn't it, Yoshimo?~
@299  = ~It cannot be undone. Do not think I would not have tried if it were possible.~
@300  = ~I thought as much. Based on my studies, it is small wonder that it has brought you to this state of affairs.~
@301  = ~I really don't like where this is going.~
@302  = ~I should have foreseen this would be. It seems that I have only myself to blame for the carelessness and assumptions leading up to this mistake.~
@303  = ~My instincts weren't wrong after all, Yoshimo. I was right about you all along. I only regret not having guessed that you were in Irenicus' service.~
@304  = ~How disappointing. This development shouldn't have been beyond my expectation, but still... as agreed, no hard feelings.~
@305  = ~Your reaction is not quite what I would expect of you.~
@306  = ~Maybe I didn't expect to react this way either. I thought I would value my own skin more, and be more distraught. But I am not, my friend, I am not.~
@307  = ~<CHARNAME>, listen! What is Yoshimo talking about?~
@308  = ~I hope I'm not the only one wondering what he means by those words to our friend here.~
@309  = ~What an interesting comment. I wonder...~
@310  = ~<CHARNAME>, I urge you to strongly reconsider this. She seems to have recovered from previously, and she even was more concerned for you initially. If not for my commitment to my case, I'd not hesitate to step out and let her take my place with you.~
@311  = ~What, we came all the way here to rescue this friend of yours, and you just dump her like that? This is hardly sane, why did we even come here in the first place, if she means so little to you?~
@312  = ~And so, after fleeing from the Cowled Wizards for a few months, I finally find myself not only incarcerated in the most feared of asylums, but also in the maddest machination in that particular asylum. Delightful.~
@313  = ~Well, at least your primary concern with continued breathing seems to be in order.~
@314  = ~I wonder how much longer it will remain that way.~
@315  = ~Still, I suppose things could be worse. I could be in here on my own.~
@316  = ~I thought prior to this you were largely used to being on your own.~
@317  = ~So long as I'm not alone with you, I'm good.~
@318  = ~Yet another one of the many instances in my life when I regret not acting on my suspicions. Unlike previous such instances, though, it would appear to be fatal on this occasion.~
@319  = ~Well, I guess it's of some consolation to know that it took some planning for us to be dispatched in this fashion.~
@320  = ~A child, incarcerated here? This... this should not be, and especially not by cold, heartless wizards!~
@321  = ~Perhaps she would have had nowhere else to go, but I could be wrong.~
@322  = ~Just desserts, I suppose, for a Cowled Wizard. Still, I wonder who or what could have done this to one powerful enough to have overseen the work here.~
@323  = ~Finally, it seems, an inmate who does deserve to belong here.~
@324  = ~What? Is this the person we came all the way here to rescue?~
@325  = ~Wait... something is very wrong here, <CHARNAME>. I think it might be best if you chose words wisely, or something might just snap on the inside.~
@326  = ~His words seem reasonable enough. If I didn't know the Cowled Wizards better, I'd almost accept his words at face value.~
@327  = ~Reasonable, yes, almost too reasonable. We had best be wary here.~
@328  = ~This man seems a bit too composed, too reasonable, for a Cowled Wizard. I say we'd best be wary, and sometimes the first strike makes for a better one.~
@329  = ~It might be for the better. Where else would she have gone, since even her parents cast her aside? Others would probably try to kill her, if she were left outside.~
@330  = ~That is true, but that doesn't make this imprisonment any more correct! There are other places...~
@331  = ~Just desserts, I suppose, for a Cowled Wizard. Still, I wonder who or what could have done this to one powerful enough to run the Asylum.~
@332  = ~Finally, it seems, someone who does indeed deserve to belong here.~
@333  = ~Something is amiss here, <CHARNAME>. And not just with your friend.~
@334  = ~You must be the one who started all this, the one who murdered <CHARNAME>'s former comrades! Where are the Cowled Wizards, and how did you free yourself?~
@335  = ~As expected, an equally lawless one, save that he plies his trade over the waves as well. If not for necessity, I would not trust this man with even the very least of things.~
@336  = ~It's a relief to be back on land. At least here there's somewhere to run, when trouble shows up.~
@337  = ~I concur with Sime. It might be best if we dealt with him first, before moving on. The way ahead is uncertain enough without having to keep looking behind our backs.~
@338  = ~At least we survived. Though my misgivings about coming to this island are increasing at a rather unhappy rate.~
@339  = ~We should have struck first. At least now we know enough to number this one among our foes.~
@340  = ~Whoever or whatever is waiting for us in Spellhold is probably aware of our coming then. Let us step carefully when we do venture into that place.~
@341  = ~Poor love-struck fool. If that last sentence about his widow had been a Stoneskin spell instead, he'd still be with us today. What a pathetic emotion love is.~
@342  = ~Innkeep! You seem to know something of this. Why has this man been killed?~
@343  = ~Even if we had the information we needed, it would not be right to let the perpetrator of this foul murder remain unpunished. Innkeeper, who is this Galvena you spoke of? Is she the one behind all this?~
@344  = ~The law of the blade is a tyranny indeed. How repulsive.~
@345  = ~I had thought this would be no more than what you expected in a place such as this.~
@346  = ~That doesn't make it any less of the mockery it is.~
@347  = ~Something seems to be amiss with that boy. It doesn't seem like he enjoys it.~
@348  = ~Heh, aren't all thieves the same to you? Big or small, what difference does it make? They're all lawbreakers.~
@349  = ~Don't you ever get tired of needling me like that?~
@350  = ~I hope not.~
@351  = ~Let us do what we can for this girl. Though if the time comes for it, it would be good to put an end to the Pirate Lord, who is behind all of this.~
@352  = ~I am thankful to be in your company, <CHARNAME>, to see such deeds done.~
@353  = ~Sometimes I wonder, where would I be, if someone had saved me from my Chremy.~
@354  = ~It's not so much different being under our recent allies, is it?~
@355  = ~Indeed. Though perhaps, it might have been worth it to have got so far with you now.~
@356  = ~Do you mean with me? Or with all of us, in this party?~
@357  = ~You can let me know when you've decided on the answer.~
@358  = ~Today, the hand of justice has caught up with you, and your murdering, slave-dealing days are over. Your evil ends here.~
@359  = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>, something is very very wrong here.~
@360  = ~Well, the Pirate Lord lies behind that door. I sure can think of people I'd rather be associating with, but we've survived the Shadow Master, so we'll probably get by.~
@361  = ~As for being detained as inmates to gain admittance to Spellhold, I think we might really want to consider alternatives, before taking this route.~
@362  = ~They don't look like pushovers, <CHARNAME>, and I think it is better to lose some gold than lose our lives.~
@363  = ~They don't look like pushovers, <CHARNAME>, but I think we might just be able to take them on, if we play it right.~
@364  = ~Can the fine and lovely lady that my eyes see be real and not a dream?~
@365  = ~I'm quite real, yes. Who are you, and what business have you with me?~
@366  = ~Salvanas is my name, and I desire no business but to give you pleasure, my lovely doe. How should I know you, that I may have a name for your loveliness?~
@367  = ~I am Kiyone. What was your business again?~
@368  = ~I desire nothing more than to show you what it means to know pleasure, in my arms, and to feel your lovely body pressed close to mine in the throes of passion.~
@369  = ~That's nice. How much are you asking for it?~
@370  = ~What?~
@371  = ~It is your business, after all, so how much do you want?~
@372  = ~Erm... a gold piece?~
@373  = ~Sorry, you're not worth that much.~
@374  = ~Ah my lovely doe does grace me with her presence again. Might Salvanas have the pleasure of your embrace this day?~
@375  = ~That depends. How much do you want for your services?~
@376  = ~I am not a prostitute, my lady. I am naught but a man with an eye for beauty and a burning desire to know them more intimately.~
@377  = ~Really? You could have fooled me.~
@378  = ~On second thoughts, I'm afraid I don't believe you, so I'll be on my way.~
@379  = ~My lovely doe, you need not depart. I do not desire your purse, only your body.~
@380  = ~I'm sorry, I don't risk potential transactions when no price has been agreed on.~
@381  = ~So we pay them the gold to do the dirty work for them. How convenient.~
@382  = ~At least it doesn't have to do with skulduggery and murder, just protecting their interests.~
@383  = ~Despite my misgivings, I will side with thieves this day, for your cause and for the aid you have given me.~
@384  = ~I doubt any of us are happy to be here, so let's just get this over with. What's going on here?~
@385  = ~A pity Mook perished. She didn't seem the bad sort, given what I've seen.~
@386  = ~It would have been better if she had lived, but since she's dead at least we won't have to worry about what kind of report she'll be giving Aran about us.~
@387  = ~They must be rather desperate men, and it won't be easy to reason without bloodshed.~
@388  = ~Let us be watchful of the contact as well. If that man at the docks was anything to go by, we had best step carefully.~
@389  = ~They should know I'm wanted by the Shadow Thieves, and I can speak to them if you want me to.~
@390  = ~You're... here to meet with the contact too? My friend here needs protection, maybe you can help us.~
@391  = ~What are you doing? They're probably Shadow Thieves, they might recognise me!~
@392  = ~Hey, isn't this that guy they're offering a huge sum of gold on?~
@393  = ~Let's take him, Jaylos! We'll be filthy rich!~
@394  = ~What are you, a fool!? We can't go back to claim any reward!~
@395  = ~You mean... you're not going to try to kill me?~
@396  = ~We might have, but what good would it do us? There's nothing left for us with the bleeding guild.~
@397  = ~I need to meet the contact too. The Shadow Thieves have been hunting me and my friends here and we need the protection.~
@398  = ~It'll be better too, if this other guild has got its act properly together. I'd love to go back and show them a thing or two for coming after me the way they did.~
@399  = ~Right, so you have more reason than us to get in contact with them. But who told you we were here?~
@400  = ~You think I'd show my face in here if I knew there were a bunch of Shadow Thieves waiting for me? Hell no!~
@401  = ~Saw some girl last night, taking out a bunch of thieves, and went to lend a hand, though she didn't look like she needed it.~
@402  = ~She told me to get myself over here, where there'd be someone coming along, then she just... disappeared. Was... strange.~
@403  = ~Yeah, some of them give me the creeps as well.~
@404  = ~Could you talk to the contact for me? My friends and I will be waiting outside, you can call us over if he wants to meet us.~
@405  = ~I suppose I could, but only if he says yes.~
@406  = ~Thank you, we'll just wait out here then. Otherwise, we'll just have to find some other way to get ourselves an ally against the Shadow Thieves...~
@407  = ~Wait, someone is coming!~
@408  = ~What is going on here? Are all of you here to meet me? ~
@409  = ~Are you the contact?~
@410  = ~What is the name of the one you were expecting?~
@411  = ~The name is... Gracen.~
@412  = ~Very good. It is not safe for us to wait here for long. Your new berth is beneath the graveyard district, behind the blue stone doors.~
@413  = ~Yes! We are going places!~
@414  = ~Hey, Kova, it's all right! It's the contact, you can show up now.~
@415  = ~Kova?~
@416  = ~He is one of the friends of <CHARNAME>, and the mistress made a special arrangement with them that did not...~
@417  = ~What do you mean? This is confusing.~
@418  = ~These are spies! Kill them!~
@419  = ~What in the...~
@420  = ~They... they've killed Gracen!~
@421  = ~We've got what we came for, <CHARNAME>, and there's no need for more bloodshed, especially since they both have nowhere else to go.~
@422  = ~I think we can risk letting them go free, but the main question is if you agree. Do make the decision quickly, or these two will be very quickly turning hostile.~
@423  = ~I think we can let them go.~
@424  = ~Let's kill them. Dead men tell no tales.~
@425  = ~Well, if that is your wish, I suppose it would be for the best after all. And who knows what the Shadowmaster would do if he found out that they were still alive?~
@426  = ~What are you standing there for? Kill them or we'll never get out of this alive!~
@427  = ~Wait, don't be too quick to draw your weapons!~
@428  = ~Jaylos, our mission only involved obtaining information, and we really don't wish to get involved in more fighting.~
@429  = ~We... we've nowhere to go now, not after you just...~
@430  = ~We'll report to the Shadow Thieves that you and Caehan have been taken care of. As the other guild would probably still come after you, I'd suggest you both get out of Amn as quickly as you are able.~
@431  = ~It may seem like there's nothing left for you both, but believe me, there's a new lease of life waiting for you, if you run fast and far enough.~
@432  = ~Then we'd best be going, before you be changing your minds.~
@433  = ~A rather impressive performance back there, Kova. You lie with a masterful flair.~
@434  = ~That is not something I am proud of, but at least it has helped preserve the lives of others.~
@435  = ~Yes, it has. Namely the lives of two traitorous thieves.~
@436  = ~Two lives, nonetheless.~
@437  = ~You seem to forget, they are thieves, they are lawless, they are criminals. If you hadn't been so quick-tongued, they would have tried to slit our throats without a second thought.~
@438  = ~And you let them go, just like that.~
@439  = ~I'm a thief as well, in case you forgot.~
@440  = ~It's not the same. These two are the faithless ones, even among the Shadow Thieves. They are the greedy ones, drawn by the attraction of the offer.~
@441  = ~You released them today, not knowing who else they will kill, even elsewhere, out of Amn. Not to mention putting our standing with Aran in danger if they are found to be alive.~
@442  = ~I'm not naive, they will not return, there is nothing left for them. Unless they get caught on their way out.~
@443  = ~And if they manage to leave Amn in one piece, they might learn from this act of mercy and leave the life of lawlessness. For the kindness that they have received here.~
@444  = ~Yes, a kindness that was born out of lies and a cold blooded, calculated murder on your part.~
@445  = ~The justice that was their due had not been administered, and they walked away from their guilt scot-free.~
@446  = ~Well fine! Why didn't you stop us from letting them go? Why didn't you shoot them in the back as they left?~
@447  = ~I chose to let them go because I respected yours and <CHARNAME>'s decision. But I want you to open your eyes up to what you are doing, and the possible consequences.~
@448  = ~Bah, I've enough consequences to handle. I just hope to do some kindness before this whole expedition of ours winds up in my death.~
@449  = ~Even if that were true, then, you should have at least some consideration for the rest of us, especially for <CHARNAME>, whose cause you could further imperil.~
@450  = ~I thank you for the service you have rendered, and to further show my sign of my goodwill, I've ordered the bounty on Kova's head to be removed.~
@451  = ~No doubt the guildmaster who wants his head will still provide a private reward for him, but for the larger part his efforts in that direction will have been stymied.~
@452  = ~That's a relief of sorts. What's the catch?~
@453  = ~This is however, not quite the end of what needs to be done.~
@454  = ~So, off we go to clean out a nest of vampires. Is it just me, or does this seem a somewhat tall order for us mere mortals?~
@455  = ~Aran certainly knows how to make full use of our services. Still, now that we're aware of this, we're almost obliged to weed this evil out from the city, even if he had not ordered us to.~
@456  = ~We cannot fight here, <CHARNAME>! Let us pull back to a safer position!~
@457  = ~I am starting to get the feeling it's a place we don't want to be.~
@458  = ~Let me know of your decision to leave when you've done discussing it with your friends. The captain is waiting.~
@459  = ~I believe we've made enough of the investigation on Kova's case to leave for this time, and when we return we can finish up the case properly. I have no qualms about an immediate departure.~
@460  = ~Much as I understand your wish to rescue Imoen, I feel that there are more clues that needs to be uncovered regarding Kova's case before we are to leave.~
@461  = ~Nonetheless I will stand by your decision, <CHARNAME>, if you should choose to leave immediately.~
@462  = ~I feel there is still more that needs attending to regarding the case I'm handling for Kova, but if you feel we have tarried enough here, <CHARNAME>, then to Spellhold we shall go.~
@463  = ~Progress on Kova's case has proved adequate, and it should be fairly simple to wrap it up when we return. I have no worries about leaving immediately.~
@464  = ~One of the seniors among the Cowled Wizards? It would be best to be careful in dealing with any of them.~
@465  = ~Still, I could be speaking out of my understandable, personal bias.~
@466  = ~This secrecy speaks ill of this matter. It would be best to set the matter aside.~
@467  = ~Well, now that you have agreed to it I suppose we are bound to carry it out, unless new information comes to light.~
@468  = ~At least we know he is a murderer, though it might not be as simple as that. It would be good to talk with this man before we do anything irreversible.~
@469  = ~So this is why they want him. Small wonder, that he became a murderer. The Cowled Wizards are indeed as careless of human lives and free will as I have heard.~
@470  = ~If his story is indeed true, then we should do what we can to help and protect this man.~
@471  = ~Yet another hunted by the wizards, but for an even more wretched reason than I. It would sit ill with me to raise a hand against him.~
@472  = ~It appears I was mistaken to have chosen to join you, if you would raise your blade to this man. I'm afraid it is time for me to rectify that oversight.~
@473  = ~I cannot allow you to play the puppet to the schemes of the Wizards against what is righteous, <CHARNAME>. I only wished I perceived your true nature the sooner.~
@474  = ~His words do not ring false, and I see no reason to doubt them. He is one among us rangers, as well, and even in the face of death few of us would lie cravenly.~
@475  = ~Not a bad bargain, I suppose. Since we already have the Cowled Wizards hot on our heels anyway, one more reason to murder the whole lot of us shouldn't hurt too much.~
@476  = ~Now we just have to look forward to the simple matter of killing an evil wizard a millennium old who has probably travelled the planes, honing his dark arts and remaining undefeated. Delightful.~
@477  = ~You know, I do wish you'd keep your perception of reality to yourself at times.~
@478  = ~We might be able to help them out, but first we must attend to ourselves. Perhaps they may have useful information for us about the way ahead.~
@479  = ~That is a rather interesting perspective. As if one powerful necromancer weren't enough... here's to surviving.~
@480  = ~I say it is a ruse, a trap, but we have little choice. I would that we could just finish him now, but we have to get back to our world somehow.~
@481  = ~No, Kiyone. I feel that he speaks the truth, and we should aid him if we can.~
@482  = ~I say it is a ruse, a trap, but we may have little choice. I would that we could just finish him now, but we have to get back to our world somehow.~
@483  = ~A rather satisfying death, I think. It is rare that putting an end to someone feels so satisfying to me.~
@484  = ~I can't say I enjoyed that, but I can see your point.~
@485  = ~Here's one step closer to the end of your travails, Valygar.~
@486  = ~Thank you, but no doubt there is more that needs to be done.~
@487  = ~For what evil he has done, I'd say let him rot in here. Still, an agreement is an agreement that we should abide by.~
@488  = ~I would like to think that he was redeemed at the end, Valygar, but perhaps that is because I am myself guilty, albeit of less than him.~
@489  = ~We'll never know, I suppose. Perhaps man was never made to judge his fellow.~
@490  = ~And so he is at an end. Was the price he paid heavy enough for the evils he did? Did the repentance for his misdeeds come too late?~
@491  = ~Surely <CHARNAME>, even if he truly deserved to rot in here, as indeed he probably does, we could at least have showed him some small kindness before his end?~
@492  = ~Was the price he paid not heavy enough for the evils he did? Did his repentance truly come too late?~
@493  = ~Whatever it may be, he is dead now, and there is no need to be incensed. Perhaps man was never made to judge his fellow.~
@494  = ~That explains quite a bit. I have scarce time for plays, but certainly that earlier segment was hardly what I would consider entertaining.~
@495  = ~There might be something here for us, that we can help set right. Yet one has to beware of trickery and half-truths in dealing with such bards.~
@496  = ~This could be just ill fortune, or that this troupe tends to get up to activities that stretch the law.~
@497  = ~Or simply be poor enough to be unable to or choose not to bribe the authorities.~
@498  = ~Interesting how the gem is worth more than one of their actor's life.~
@499  = ~Surely hearing out their problem would not have done us any harm.~
@500  = ~This is an interesting turn of events, but so long there is no treachery or new dangers involved in this, we may stay and hear what of what there is to come.~
@501  = ~Well, I guessed there was more to that gem than was apparent, but I can't say the possibility of a conduit ever came to mind. I never even thought I'd see such a thing as planar travel about in my time.~
@502  = ~If it were up to me, I'm not very keen on facing planar creatures. Those of this plane are bad enough, but I get the feeling you would think otherwise, <CHARNAME>.~
@503  = ~The creatures might be, as you say, dangerous, but if miss Raelis needs our help we may as well see to the completion of our favours to this band.~
@504  = ~We have enough enemies in this plane of existence than to make more from other planes of existence. And these do not look paltry foes by any means.~
@505  = ~While we have not known this band for long, it would be best if we could at least do something for them... though I'm not sure how much is too much.~
@506  = ~I can sense power from this wizard and I think it would be best to use some tact here.~
@507  = ~A thief eh? Well, we might be played for fools by the ones who sent us, but a life is a life still. Name us your price then, that we might make recompense for the disturbance he has caused you, good sir.~
@508  = ~I wouldn't be comfortable taking anyone as a slave, <CHARNAME>. Stooping to the level of the wizard isn't what I'd see any of us doing.~
@509  = ~Let no slaves be taken, for we shouldn't stoop to such misdeeds as the wizard did.~
@510  = ~Bards. Scraped out of a bad situation and all they can think of is to make a nice poem out of it, rather than learn how to avoid it in future. Bah.~
@511  = ~It seems the taint of slavery is rampant even here on the other planes. Let it be punished no differently.~
@512  = ~Great. I'd be inclined to agree with him, but that would serve no purpose. I think we'd best be ready for a stiff fight.~
@513  = ~Yes, just as we'd rather risk life and limb on another plane for a bunch of strangers rather than continue living our lives on the prime material plane. Delightful.~
@514  = ~That is the course of action we must take, then. If we could do something for those enslaved here, then we should.~
@515  = ~Sometimes I wish you'd think more about our own interests, but currently it would seem that aim is the preferable one, and that would be the way to go.~
@516  = ~It's no more than what should have been done long ago. What of your fellow thralls now?~
@517  = ~I suppose it was worth it after all, to know that those who survived have been helped, to some extent. A fair deed, though it only benefitted us so much, and I wonder if it was worth it.~
@518  = ~All such deeds are worth it, Kova. Even if the stakes seem high initially, and even if we do lose our own lives in the process, its still worth it.~
@519  = ~My mind tells me that makes extremely little sense, Kiyone. Yet deep down inside me, I cannot disagree. And frankly, I don't know whether to be pleased or frightened by that realisation.~
@520  = ~So all emotions run their course. A short or long road, it leads to an end.~
@521  = ~Such sentiments were never reliable to begin with, at least in most people.~
@522  = ~That's strange - that may be the voice of a beast, but not the words of one...~
@523  = ~It is as I feared, that these were not monsters, but that they appear to be knights only makes the matter worse.~
@524  = ~This bodes ill and weighs heavily on my heart, and I fear we would be undone completely were this man here not a witness to what had happened.~
@525  = ~Though I suspect our need for his testimony and witness exceeds that of our need for rest, accepting his offer could be welcome.~
@526  = ~Even if we were not framed by this Lord Jierdan, and even if Garren had not helped us, I would see that the injustice done to him is redressed.~
@527  = ~When this matter of ours is laid to rest, let us do what we can to restore to him what honor he has lost to treachery. It's the least we could do for a man so kind to us, even if his motivations are unclear.~
@528  = ~Even if we were not framed by this Lord Firkraag, and even if Garren had not helped us, I would see that the injustice done to him is redressed.~
@529  = ~This gross injustice must not be left unresolved. Let us make haste to set matters aright for this man.~
@530  = ~The temerity of this Firkraag astounds me. We must face this evil creature and put an end to him.~
@531  = ~This note speaks of the Northeast, but I think there's nothing much there except some ruins. You've been in this region a while, Kova - think it is likely that this Firkraag may be found within?~
@532  = ~Maybe if we can locate Kova and hold him for long enough to get information out of him, we might have some aid against this villain.~
@533  = ~There's a recent troubling matter that we came across here, Kova, and I'd appreciate what information you can provide about what has been going on in here.~
@534  = ~A man who lives close by, Garren by name, has had his child kidnapped by one Jierdan Firkraag. This Firkraag is also the same person who has framed <CHARNAME> for the murders of some knights, and is the reigning lord of this land.~
@535  = ~And I suppose you must have enough evidence for you to state plainly that this Firkraag is indeed the culprit.~
@536  = ~Do not mock me, Kova. I have seen enough to have strong reason to believe him the culprit, even in the absence of more definitive evidence. Speak what you know of him, if anything.~
@537  = ~I have observed this Garren and his child about, and they appear kind people who would have few enemies. But as for this Firkraag, I have only heard his name before I left Athkatla, and not after.~
@538  = ~These hills are wild, where bandits, orcs and other monsters prowl freely, and scarcely would there appear to be any reigning lord of these lands.~
@539  = ~It appears that way to me as well, though why it is left this way I do not know. And do you know anything of the ruins northeast of this area? We have been told Firkraag might be somewhere about there.~
@540  = ~A noble staying in those ruins? That would be a strange thing indeed. No, all that I've seen of it are orcs and their ilk milling about it, and they seem to be the most organised as any I've ever seen. And worse... I fear.~
@541  = ~Something that would bring fear into you? I find that thought hard to believe.~
@542  = ~I thought I saw a great winged beast descend upon those ruins about one month ago, in the dead of the night. I can only guess what it was, and the fear it gave me was as real as any I've ever felt in my life, so much so that I started north after that.~
@543  = ~If I were you, I would not venture into that place. More than likely it is a trap to mislead us to our deaths, than a place to house a noble and a captured child.~
@544  = ~If it is a den of filthy beasts as you claim it to be, then we should proceed with caution to eradicate their menace. Firkraag and the child might not be there, but at least we would have accomplished something, and there may be clues leading us onward.~
@545  = ~Sometimes, I think you're delightfully mad, Kiyone. But then again, there is nothing much left for me to lose, so I may as well see what good I can do with what little of my life I have left.~
@546  = ~Looks like at least we know Firkraag is somewhere about here, unlikely place though it seems.~
@547  = ~Hrah! You go meet Firkraag, then you be sorry.~
@548  = ~I am certain these people are not entirely truthful, and do not mean us well. I would think twice about heeding his words if I were you.~
@549  = ~Whoever these people say they are, I am certain they do not mean us well. Either they are in league with the orcs, or something else. Let us be wary.~
@550  = ~The child's fear is almost palpable. I wonder what might inspire such strong fear.~
@551  = ~Still, our course is set and we proceed onward. We may not know what Firkraag has in store for us, but we can steel ourselves for the battle ahead.~
@552  = ~What in the world...?!~
@553  = ~I think now would be a good time to get going.~
@554  = ~While we may not be able to match you, creature, we will rescue Garren's child. Let you not doubt that for even a moment.~
@555  = ~Wizards, we can deal with. How about we just hurry on our way to save the child?~
@556  = ~This is not the end of it, foul beast! We will return, someday, and smite you for your evil.~
@557  = ~Yes, I suppose it will come to that, eventually. I wouldn't mind, so long as I'm not involved when it happens. Though it doesn't do me all that much good, I still place some value on my continued breathing.~
@558  = ~The things people will stoop to doing in return for rewards. I pity this man as much as I despise him.~
@559  = ~More reason to despise than to pity. He chose his path, just as others have. And there are worse things yet that men have done, and will do, for money.~
@560  = ~I doubt there are any powers that only block those of specific heritage, based on what I know of magic. It'd be closer to truth to assume this woman is lying, and we should leave to get on with our task.~
@561  = ~A barrier that prevents her entry yet one we could pass beyond? A little far-fetched, and I suspect its more to do with letting us stand in while she cowardly watches our efforts.~
@562  = ~Why am I not surprised? Let's get on with this unpleasant business then. Much as I dislike killing I'd prefer someone else's blood spilt rather than my own.~
@563  = ~You treacherous creature, it's just as well you have exposed yourself, that I may in certainty give your mercenary tendencies what it justly deserves.~
@564  = ~Intrigue among thieves does not concern us, <CHARNAME>. Even if there is money to be made out of this, it wouldn't be worth it to stoop to skulduggery.~
@565  = ~At least we are pitted against another thief, I suppose. Better than being up against honest folk.~
@566  = ~I've seen Mae'Var about, for he used to serve under my Guildmaster Seida, prior to becoming a Guildmaster within the Shadow Thieves. We might get some information from documents of his.~
@567  = ~Good then. I am also reminded, that Renal himself should also be a fine source of information once we get on the right side of him.~
@568  = ~Though I doubt such information will come cheaply.~
@569  = ~This Renal, outlaw though he is, might also be a fine source of information once we get on the right side of him.~
@570  = ~Hello then, I certainly hope you've got a reason to be bothering me, because I'm quite busy, as you can see. Ah, poor Lin passed out. I've a few minutes to spare then. Who are you and why shouldn't I kill you?~
@571  = ~Wait, I do know you, or one of you, rather. Kova, isn't it? Seida would be most pleased if I pay you back well on his behalf.~
@572  = ~Hmm, that chap with you looks familiar. Kova, isn't it? Seida would be most pleased if I pay you back well on his behalf.~
@573  = ~You're not one of his men now, Mae'Var. You don't have to do what he wants.~
@574  = ~Oh but in this case, I want to. I've never liked you much anyway, and I'm sure the feeling is at least mutual. And even if I did, your scalp is worth quite a bit now, which is quite a surprise for a pansy like you.~
@575  = ~Then, of course, it follows that those with you can't be Renal's own men. Spies, probably. No matter, I'll just kill you all.~
@576  = ~Then it will be a pleasure to rid this world of the stain of your filth.~
@577  = ~This is a lawless act and unrighteous, even though the target can scarce be innocent of ill deeds, and it makes me ill to think I should have a hand in this.~
@578  = ~I do not trust that Red Wizard, and I am uneasy serving his cause. Still, he does not seem as part of Mae'Var's guild, and might serve our interests if we make it worth his while.~
@579  = ~Well, at least you are right at home in all of this. How much I loathe serving any one of these lawless cretins, you can't even begin to imagine... still, I look forward to seeing that Mae'Var dead.~
@580  = ~I question this man's motivations, but for now it might serve if he joined us.~
@581  = ~I think it better that we meet him elsewhere after wrapping up this business. If he could do this to Mae'Var he could well do it to us.~
@582  = ~Despite his murky background, I fear we have lost one who might otherwise have been of great assistance to my case.~
@583  = ~Still, I suppose there is little for it but to continue onward as we may.~
@584  = ~Calm yourself, we don't wish to kill you unless you attack us first. What's this misunderstanding about?~
@585  = ~Interesting information, but probably not what Renal wants. This man may be deserving of death for other crimes, but I am reluctant to strike him down simply because Mae'Var tells us to.~
@586  = ~Yet another escapes grief at the hands of the Shadow Thieves, and I am grateful. I was worried it would come to bloodshed, yet if I were to speak up and he recognise me we would almost have to be compelled to kill him.~
@587  = ~Though, who would have thought one such as lady Kiyone would be willing to let a thief off unpunished?~
@588  = ~And you should have a rather more pleasant way of communicating your compliments.~
@589  = ~My apologies, I will try harder next time. If I remember, of course.~
@590  = ~To consider such an offer is most unbecoming. I can just tolerate having a hand in this so far, but to be openly linked to a guildmaster of the Shadow Thieves is something else entirely.~
@591  = ~Don't be too hasty to judge. Better that one of us should have the mastery than it fall to a stranger that could well be worse than Mae'Var.~
@592  = ~Do as you will, <CHARNAME>, and I'll do as I will. I will abide no more in your company - it has become a stench to me.~
@593  = ~I apologise, good sir. We did not intend to trespass on your grounds.~
@594  = ~Whoever owns this place is certainly powerful and not lacking in aggression nor malice when it comes to being left undisturbed.~
@595  = ~And probably not lacking in deeds ill and evil.~
@596  = ~We have no evidence on that matter yet.~
@597  = ~I think we should just strike first before they've had the chance to do ill to others. Assuming that they haven't done so already, which would be quite a stretch.~
@598  = ~Well, we'll just have to see what comes, as <CHARNAME> chooses to direct us.~
@599  = ~Good to see ye back in me forge, it is. Be there something that ye need?~
@600  = ~Well, if it isn't the boy who has some fine eye for good work, and fine coin to pay it for it too.~
@601  = ~How's it been with ye, lad? That blade and those leather robes of yours holding up fine?~
@602  = ~Yes, master Cromwell. I urgently need your help regarding a case of mine.~
@603  = ~That so, lad? Forgework is me strength, and with the law and all tis best to look elsewhere.~
@604  = ~We just need to know, if anyone else came and you forged him a blade like mine.~
@605  = ~Give me a while to be thinking, me memory's not as good as it once was, not about matters outside of the forge.~
@606  = ~Aye, remember now. Was someone coming in with a large number of weapons, all kinds of them, asking for me to make something just like that blade of yours.~
@607  = ~Only, unlike ye, who be knowing what ye want it to be doing. he didn't seem to know what it was supposed to do, just how it looked like. Probably saw yours and wanted one just like it.~
@608  = ~He's definitely not the only one.~
@609  = ~Yes, that would be the person. How did he look like?~
@610  = ~Don't rightly know, me lad. He was all covered up in his clothes and all, couldn't even see his face if I wanted to. Paid right good gold though. Tall fellow though, even compared to you people. Probably human.~
@611  = ~What else was there about him? Did he leave any clues, anything special about him?~
@612  = ~Not much more to tell ye, he didn't leave much behind apart from his gold. Perhaps he took care not to, but I've learnt it don't usually pay to ask too much of me customers.~
@613  = ~Damn it...~
@614  = ~Thank you Master Cromwell, I'm sorry to have troubled you with such matters.~
@615  = ~Not a problem, me lad. All the best with whatever you're looking for.~
@616  = ~So, my friend, this must be the one who helped you with your weapon.~
@617  = ~Indeed he is, Yoshimo. He should be able to help you with yours as well.~
@618  = ~Excuse me, do you suppose you might be able to help Yoshimo with improving his blade?~
@619  = ~Well, if it isn't the soft footed lad who has some fine eye for good work, and fine coin to pay it for it too.~
@620  = ~How's it been with ye, boy? That blade and those leather robes of yours holding up fine?~
@621  = ~Fine enough to keep me breathing, master Cromwell. And that's more than good enough for me.~
@622  = ~Glad to hear it, lad. Who is this with ye here? Something I can do for <HIMHER>?~
@623  = ~Well, I see ye've gone and got this lad here with ye, eh? He has some fine eye for good work, and coin to pay it for it too.~
@624  = ~Glad to hear it, lad. Now, something ye be wanting me for, <GABBER>?~
@625  = ~Indeed he is, Yoshimo. And he should be able to help you with yours as well.~
@626  = ~The Order certainly has resources enough to handle most difficulties. Let us turn to someone else more needy.~
@627  = ~Say not so. If the righteous need help, all the more we should provide it.~
@628  = ~I think aid should go where it is more urgently needed. Still, it is up to <CHARNAME> to decide.~
@629  = ~This is a rare opportunity to serve the Order of the Radiant Heart, and a great honor indeed. I hope we do not pass up this chance.~
@630  = ~This task does not sit well with me. We are to execute men simply because they fail to live up to some prescribed standard set by the Order?~
@631  = ~And for no reason other than to preserve the name and honor of the Order? That strikes me as more evil than robbing and killing someone to spend the loot on bread.~
@632  = ~Though, if what he says about their smuggling slaves and extorting from the poor is true, then it would be right to do so. Let us not be too quick to draw our blades on these people.~
@633  = ~I suppose I should be honored to have served, but this whole episode does leave a slightly bitter taste on my tongue.~
@634  = ~Thus I am reminded that no matter how high we rise, we can never rise above the possibility of falling from truth. It is something to reflect on within myself.~
@635  = ~This man seems yet a good soul. I would that we will not come to blows. Perhaps we can dissuade him from remaining in his current company.~
@636  = ~Though he has fallen I think there is yet a good spirit in him, though it is far from perfect. If possible, let us find a way to have him leave this band he keeps company with.~
@637  = ~A most unpleasant fate, done by a most unpleasant hand. Whose owner I would happily put paid to.~
@638  = ~The perpetrator of such a misdeed must be found and held accountable for this, if more lives are not to be put in danger.~
@639  = ~Don't even think of going anywhere, gentlemen. Lay aside your weapons or you will not live to see the judgment of the courts.~
@640  = ~Ha, ye be thinking to stop us lass? Let's see how good you be looking with my axe in ye guts.~
@641  = ~You know, you needn't always give them a chance to stand down their arms.~
@642  = ~Bah, what charity I might have felt for her is lost when this noble pig opens her mouth.~
@643  = ~She probably lost her courtesy from her ordeal. In any case, regardless of her tone, it is fitting that we free her.~
@644  = ~Though she hardly knows much courtesy, perhaps her ordeal has taken it from her. Let us do as is right and free her.~
@645  = ~What we are doing is most wrong and unacceptable, <CHARNAME>. If you aren't upstanding enough to do what is right, I shall have to do it for you.~
@646  = ~There, you are free to go, my lady.~
@647  = ~Humph, I do not know who you are, but you'd do best to watch your company.~
@648  = ~There is a great evil in this place. Please, <CHARNAME>, let us quickly depart from here at once!~
@649  = ~It is well we did not help this... thing. Though its evil cannot yet extend to us, the sooner we are away, the better.~
@650  = ~There is something very very wrong here, A great power and a great malice... I do not think it wise to fulfil the request of this... thing.~
@651  = ~We do not need to keep our word to being of such great evil. I would that we leave this place and never return.~
@652  = ~No, stop!~
@653  = ~Too late, mortals!~
@654  = ~May the Gods preserve us...~
@655  = ~This sign on the ground seems familiar. Is it not that of Mystra? Yet, this place strikes dread into my heart.~
@656  = ~The Twisted Rune... can such ancient, whispered things be more than a distant tale of evil?~
@657  = ~If it is, then let us put an end to it this day, or die in the attempt.~
@658  = ~That creature spoke about an army, probably of these vicious beasts. I shudder to think of what might have happened if he had not been stopped.~
@659  = ~I think it might be a good idea for us to leave before things get needlessly unpleasant.~
@660  = ~He is punished justly for failing his vow. Still I would that there was some way to help him.~
@661  = ~How burdensome the weight of emotions. I hope I never wind up in such a position.~
@662  = ~I am glad we found a way to help them both.~
@663  = ~This is a good and pleasing deed. Meaningless, perhaps, but heartwarming nonetheless.~
@664  = ~Such callousness as you have shown, <CHARNAME>, hardly seems appropriate.~
@665  = ~I hope we can yet find some way to help this child. It would not do to leave her this way.~
@666  = ~Perhaps there might be a way, if we tell him about the paladin we spoke to earlier.~
@667  = ~Really, why shouldn't we help? It sounds like something interesting to do.~
@668  = ~Yet probably not the best. We want kids to stay out of trouble, not to run off and get killed somewhere.~
@669  = ~And to think I thought you'd make a good parent. Still, the choice is up to <CHARNAME>.~
@670  = ~Calm down, good sir. We've no wish to take anything from you that would be from your daughter, that you may have something to remember her by.~
@671  = ~Here, sir. This amount of gold should be more than fitting for the momento of your daughter.~
@672  = ~Here, sir. We don't have much, but I hope this is at least enough for the momento of your daughter.~
@673  = ~It is not right to leave a man this way when we could lift our hand to help.~
@674  = ~I cannot help but think ill of you if you will not even do what you can to assist this man.~
@675  = ~Let us make haste then, that we may make it on time for this man's cause.~
@676  = ~Harpers, here, right in the middle of the Shadow Thief bastions? This is amusing news indeed, though probably not new to the higher level operatives.~
@677  = ~Whoever the Harpers would make trouble for probably means ill to the world at large. It would be best not to assist him in this matter.~
@678  = ~This decision puts me ill at ease, but it is your choice, and I will abide by it.~
@679  = ~Interesting. I shall remember this means of achieving an end. If for no other reason other than to guard myself against such.~
@680  = ~While I do not appreciate being duped, nor being left in the dark as to why he was killed, he probably deserved it, and it is quite an eye-opener to see how Harper justice is done.~
@681  = ~That is such a heartbreaking thing to learn of. I hope we can get him his bear.~
@682  = ~I thought you didn't like feeling so much for others.~
@683  = ~He was just a little boy. How could I not feel something?~
@684  = ~Yes, my dear Wellyn. Littleman has missed you. Now its time to go to bed.~
@685  = ~You have him!  You have him!  Oh, thank you, mama, thank you!  I can go to sleep, now!  Thank you!!~
@686  = ~Sleep tight, my boy.~
@687  = ~Are you all right?~
@688  = ~I'm fine, just give me a moment alone.~
@689  = ~Are you Llynis?~
@690  = ~Why, yes. How did ye know?~
@691  = ~That's a terribly frightenin` look ye be givin' me, lady...~
@692  = ~Before I continue, I would just like to ask - what ever possessed you to kill a small helpless boy? Why did you ever do so a thing?~
@693  = ~I... well...~
@694  = ~Why? Was it to take away his stuffed toy?~
@695  = ~Bah, I'll just kill ye all and be done with it!~
@696  = ~Then, in the name of all that is good, die! Die and burn forever!~
@697  = ~Oh, darling!  I'm so sorry!  Let's go home, alright, sweetums?~
@698  = ~Such a futile thing is love. It fights for, dies for, and is scarce remembered. Truly an emotion for the weak of mind and heart. Bah!~
@699  = ~Sorry, nothing. We're getting married, Rumie...NOW.~
@700  = ~Such a poor futile thing it is, love. She will probably end up like the woman she just killed - fought for, died for, and forgotten. Because of love, more is the evil done.~
@701  = ~Poor, unfortunate fools. Shedding their blood for the sake of love. Surely much sorrow is wrought in such useless gestures, that probably won't even serve to win what they desire.~
@702  = ~The world would probably be better for an absence of such a weak, vexing emotion.~
@703  = ~This is a most evil act, <CHARNAME>. Let us find out more that we may put an end to it.~
@704  = ~Ugh. What cruel madness would compel such a senseless act of evil?~
@705  = ~Even the tortures I heard of among the Shadow Thieves would not have been of such a fashion, and those were means to an end.~
@706  = ~I get the feeling that is not the wisest course of action for him to take.~
@707  = ~Perhaps we ought to hurry after him, then. Better safe than sorry.~
@708  = ~I'll be on my way now.~
@709  = ~I doubt beggars would be too choosy about the price, so long as they get something out of it.~
@710  = ~Besides, too much money in their pocket would probably see them in a gutter with their throat slit.~
@711  = ~Alright, here is your hundred. Now, what is it that you found?~
@712  = ~I do not have that much gold.~
@713  = ~Gah, such a one disgusts me.~
@714  = ~Really? Maybe you should get to know them better, do some business perhaps - you might find yourself getting fond of them.~
@715  = ~Well, that about clinches it, then. Now all that is left is to bring the vile, murdering tanner to justice.~
@716  = ~Well, that was helpful. Still, we can't be too sure - a little more evidence should clinch it.~
@717  = ~Well, that was helpful, and now we have a name of a suspect. Still, we can't be too sure - a little more evidence should clinch it, if he is truly the suspect.~
@718  = ~This place sickens me with the stench of death. Let us make haste from here.~
@719  = ~There are probably traps in here though, to see that we don't quite catch up with our quarry.~
@720  = ~A fitting deed. Though I do not know how you came by such, and though it may mean little to most mortals, such a deed is praiseworthy still.~
@721  = ~Jermien? If so, this is the wizard with the information we need. Still, I doubt he'd be willing to just give it to us.~
@722  = ~If possible, we should try to help him should he need anything - he might prove grateful enough to be of assistance.~
@723  = ~The cause he serves rings true, <CHARNAME>, so let us aid him if we can.~
@724  = ~That's strange, his wounds do not seem all that grievous to be unable to handle an unconscious enemy like that.~
@725  = ~A worthy plan befitting such vile minds. I hope we do not leave this girl to suffer for it.~
@726  = ~Then let us do what we may to help cleanse her of the taint of darkness.~
@727  = ~So it is done. A pleasing thing, to return to where she belongs to. How different from myself.~
@728  = ~Still, the path of love and marriage, as emotionally driven as they are known to be, will prove a different sort of trial ahead for them both.~
@729  = ~Though we have not met before, I'd recognise you anywhere, Neb!~
@730  = ~Why friend, who told you my name? Why such... great anger?~
@731  = ~All you need to know is that I will kill you for the wickedness you have done!~
@732  = ~So, my former life does come back to haunt? So be it, though I shall miss the children so. Ah yes, the children...~
@733  = ~Speak not of them, you thrice accursed devil!~
@734  = ~Oh but they're here with us... hee hee! You shall be very sorry, very sorry to have found me out, because now you must pay, oh yes. A little old for my taste, but no matter!~
@735  = ~And your evil is now over. May you remain ever dead, ever damned! Burn forever in the pits of hell!~
@736  = ~Kiyone, are you all right?~
@737  = ~I... I'm okay, I'm fine.~
@738  = ~I've never seen you so worked up over anyone before. Especially as this was one you've never met before.~
@739  = ~He murdered children, Kova. For the fun of it.~
@740  = ~Ah, I see. Still, let's keep our wits sharp. There might be more danger in here.~
@741  = ~Yes, you're right. That would be the best thing to do, for now.~
@742  = ~It would not be fitting to leave this child in the lurch.~
@743  = ~Calm down now, my boy. We will see if we can help if only you will tell us what the problem is.~
@744  = ~This could be more serious than a few people panicking, if a ranger is lost and a band of adventurers has yet to return.~
@745  = ~Mazzy Fentan? I have heard of her name somewhat. If she has not returned, then we had best be watching ourselves with care as well.~
@746  = ~I don't believe in legends, nor am I familiar with this Mazzy character, but if it took out the previous adventurers, it is real enough to be wary of.~
@747  = ~And real enough to put an end to.~
@748  = ~If I didn't know you better, I'd think you were just waiting to spring that on me.~
@749  = ~You simply must think that way all the time, don't you?~
@750  = ~I'm not the best at reading ogre expressions, but his uneasiness might just be genuine.~
@751  = ~If what they say is true, it would be a great ill to do them harm.~
@752  = ~Thank you for bringing this to my attention, my <LADYLORD>. I will have to...go and talk to them, I suppose. We could both benefit from this.~
@753  = ~I hope things go well between him and the ogre. A little naive, perhaps, but such little things give me some heart for my own cause.~
@754  = ~It is of some comfort to know that this has gone well, even for creatures such as these. Would that it would be so for own case.~
@755  = ~As long as I am overseeing your case, I will not rest until the truth has been brought to light.~
@756  = ~I thank you for your words, Kiyone. Still, if that should not come to pass, it is good to have seen something to bring me some pleasure, however fleeting that may be.~
@757  = ~Was this bloodshed necessary, <CHARNAME>? I guess we will never know if they were sincere in their expressed intentions. It seems the blood of many possibly far from evil tends to stain my hands.~
@758  = ~There seem to be traces of blood about this place. Things probably didn't go too well for the former occupant.~
@759  = ~The beast before us has surely killed many before, and if it does not perish against the shadows, will move to kill more. Yet something in me restrains my hand.~
@760  = ~I feel a grief about this den, an empty sorrow about this creature, rather than primal ferocity. If you will, <CHARNAME>, I hope you let her be.~
@761  = ~So, she has fallen. Strange that I should feel pity for such a beast.~
@762  = ~Still, perhaps it is better that she should fall here than to have to deal with her later.~
@763  = ~These shadows may well be employed for cover, but I feel ill at ease within them, for they seem to want to consume everything they touch.~
@764  = ~Indeed, they cling thickly around this place, and only light can pierce such deep shadows. Yet there is a source of light within, from long ago, but it has waned. Perhaps if harnessed properly it may see us through this.~
@765  = ~Could this be the Mazzy Fentan? I had thought you would look slightly different.~
@766  = ~Your grace, I am indeed her, a valiant servant of justice and righteousness. As you can see, I could use your assistance.~
@767  = ~Ah, greetings, my lady. I suppose you were here to discover the source of the evil about the land?~
@768  = ~Yes, it was for that reason I came, and it made itself abundantly clear when it slaughtered my companions at the Shadow Altar.~
@769  = ~<CHARNAME>, surely you wouldn't leave her here this way! No matter, I shall do so with my own hands.~
@770  = ~That is... sad indeed. I will avenge him, Mazzy, I promise.~
@771  = ~I do not know who you are, but I thank you for your words, my lady. And yet, even were the deed done, it would not bring him back to me.~
@772  = ~Such vileness! And such... a fate. It sickens me and fills me with grief and hate.~
@773  = ~It will pass, for we can certainly put an end to this shadow.~
@774  = ~Did you not hear of a Shadow Dragon? Since when did you think yourself capable of facing such?~
@775  = ~True, I might not be able to face it. But I'm sure you would be able.~
@776  = ~If you say so, then.~
@777  = ~Well... if you say so.~
@778  = ~If not for us, there would have been nothing for her, nothing at all. Just an eternity of torment and wretched damnation.~
@779  = ~It seems even for the righteous there is no rest to be had, no reward to be reaped. Would that I had strength to curse myself for not being evil, but there is no such will in me.~
@780  = ~Speak not such things, Kova. That road is forever closed to you.~
@781  = ~Maybe, maybe not.~
@782  = ~You delude yourself, creature. The light has come and the time of your darkness is over.~
@783  = ~The darkness has passed. Rest well, my sister.~
@784  = ~She has passed beyond human aid, Kiyone. Your words mean nothing to her.~
@785  = ~That may be so, but I speak them nonetheless.~
@786  = ~Does it trouble you that you could well have been like her? What would there be left of your righteousness and truth to hold on to, then?~
@787  = ~I do not know. Maybe there is nothing, after all, and there never was.~
@788  = ~Even if they are doing this to a drow, this is a travesty of justice and all that is right. Let us put an end to it as soon as we may.~
@789  = ~If she has truly done nothing wrong, then we must save her. Still, such creatures are proverbial for their conniving ways, and probably more so on a pyre.~
@790  = ~We may have saved you from a grim fate, but that was only the right thing to do. I would prefer it if this were the last we saw of you, drow.~
@791  = ~I find it disturbing that one so dark could stir some degree of fascination in me. Still, there is something about you that makes my soul uneasy.~
@792  = ~Really? I suppose you expect me to be flattered with that, lowly male? But you have no say in such a matter. It will be up to <CHARNAME> if you are to have the pleasure of my company for a time.~
@793  = ~So, she is dead. Whether she was guilty or innocent or otherwise, perhaps we'll never know.~
@794  = ~Our lack of action was most deplorable, <CHARNAME>. I hope that in future, we are more prompt to help those in need of aid.~
@795  = ~Such are the trials of those who do not have the strength to find their way without turning to some external power. That they have turned to now to a cult that reveres blindness, only shows what heavy burdens the churches have placed upon them.~
@796  = ~And it also goes to show that thievery is not the only way to relieve people of wealth. There's tithes, donations and of course, judiciary bribes.~
@797  = ~How dare you judge the ways of the Gods! Helm will surely smite you for this!~
@798  = ~I only comment on the ways and tongues of those who claim to act for them, Anomen.~
@799  = ~It is needless for us to get caught up in such affairs, <CHARNAME> and it does no one any lasting good. Let the people believe what they will, it is their free choice, and it's too bad if the churches can't stand it.~
@800  = ~You seem to be one of truth, sent here for a purpose. Might your name be Keldorn?~
@801  = ~There is something very wrong here, and plucking out of the eyes is only one of the signs of it. We  cannot let this cult stand.~
@802  = ~Revering a beholder as a God? What twisted road is this?~
@803  = ~Such base corruption is unheard of, and must be brought to an end.~
@804  = ~This is... a little unexpected. Past spiders, undead, beholders, a ruined temple, rotting plagued followers, we have just overcome a fallen God, and now stand before yet another?~
@805  = ~A strange sequence of events that I could scarce have imagined as possible.~
@806  = ~Could the creature that once bore this skin have been one of us? To desire to do no one any harm, yet be compelled to do so by urges beyond his control?~
@807  = ~Surely the fates make mockery of many. And to know that I am not alone in my dilemma suddenly seems more of a burden than a comfort.~
@808  = ~So, the root is one of these - an elder orb. Let us eradicate this corrupting beast from the earth!~
@809  = ~Now that the thing is dead, may the stench of its corruption be forever gone from the earth.~
@810  = ~It doesn't take a foul creature to bring forth corruption.~
@811  = ~You have a sound grasp of the obvious.~
@812  = ~Just a reminder on the reality of matters.~
@813  = ~Amaunator? It is sad thing that one so full of the light of truth should have fallen to such a state as this. Will the bringer of light now be forever no more?~
@814  = ~I see, that it is as he had spoken. All is no more. The light of truth that once illuminated ages past now shines no longer, and will never be seen again.~
@815  = ~Still, it does me good to know that our truth extends even to ease the passage of the Gods. Righteousness is truly but a step from divinity.~
@816  = ~If divinity means leaving behind such a legacy and a long drawn out demise, I'd rather be far from it.~
@817  = ~Awe-inspiring and all, yet somehow broken and lost. Is this all there is to existence, even for a God?~
@818  = ~You think too much for your own good, Kova. Yet...~
@819  = ~I think we had best leave this place. There is much for me to think about.~
@820  = ~I say we should go elsewhere and do what is righteous and just, rather than sit here and help the church with adding adornments that does no one any good.~
@821  = ~Easy for them to spend the money, for it is not their own, but rather what they have wrung from blood and toil of the people. ~
@822  = ~Another reason to detest nobility. They corrupt even the ordinary servant into treating other people like filth.~
@823  = ~Bah, I say we go now! To scuttle around for the self-righteous churches that lift not a finger to aid anyone is bad enough, and now to pander to this pompous idiot who plays entertainer to the pudgy nobility?~
@824  = ~Surely, we have better things to do than this!~
@825  = ~Why am I not surprised.~
@826  = ~And so we are reminded, that let us not be too quick in judging others by their appearance.~
@827  = ~Much as I would like to put one over that self-important worm, I have a feeling that this solution isn't going to be entirely the cheapest way out.~
@828  = ~So she's going to regale us with reasons to dig deeper into our pocket if we want anything from her.~
@829  = ~Though, in case you forgot, there's always the better way out. Such as walking away from all this and letting the churches handle it themselves.~
@830  = ~Well, he does know a thing or two after all! This is a rather unexpected, if pleasant, surprise.~
@831  = ~Ah, I mean, unpleasant.~
@832  = ~Yet another pleasant surprise - there is a voice of reason after all! Maybe Helm is a God worthy of notice after all.~
@833  = ~You, fit to judge Helm? I should run my blade through you for your impertinence!~
@834  = ~On second thoughts, maybe not.~
@835  = ~Yet another pleasant surprise - there is a voice of reason after all. Maybe Lathander is a God worthy of notice after all.~
@836  = ~Sounds familiar though... but no, I don't know him.~
@837  = ~Lathander... Dawnbringer, Morninglord. I am reminded of the one who has passed away, but there is light still, from this place.~
@838  = ~Another quest for a temple's pride?~
@839  = ~It does appear that way, I'm afraid.~
@840  = ~Well, if it is a wrong done to them, we should still do our best to redress as we would those of any other.~
@841  = ~You will speak, thief, or I shall call the wrath of the Stormlord upon you!~
@842  = ~Hey, can't blame me for trying to make a buck. Go to the red brick house on the roof of the Copper Coronet. Speak to Borinall, he's the man. I'm just the contact.~
@843  = ~Excellent. And now, your just reward for your most satisfactory service - shall be death!~
@844  = ~What? I've done as you asked! Damn it! I knew I shouldn't have got in the middle of a deal with Talassans! You'll not have me!~
@845  = ~I doubt he'll be too ready to get involved in another scheme of anybody's next time.~
@846  = ~Perhaps. You certainly looked like you enjoyed yourself, though.~
@847  = ~Why yes. I've always wanted to do something like this. Much preferable to killing.~
@848  = ~This man looks like he's prepared for quite a few eventualities, including lies. I'd strongly suggest discretion.~
@849  = ~Wait, I see a familiar face there. Well, if it isn't the infamous Kova Kashiro!~
@850  = ~Ah, what a stroke of fortune. In any case, I'm certain he wouldn't be part of any church, and especially not with the Talassans, that's for sure.~
@851  = ~I think I'll just have to take care of all of you now, and get that reward as well.~
@852  = ~How ironic. If I were a Shadow Thief, I'd almost be obliged to be interested in the matter of Trademeet, as it would probably affect our income sources from all about the place.~
@853  = ~As things are, I don't see why we should even be bothered with helping the richer get richer, or stay rich, as things sound.~
@854  = ~Druids. Who knows what they are up to.~
@855  = ~They are our fellow guardians of the wilds, Kova, and to hear such news of them disturbs me greatly.~
@856  = ~They are our fellow guardians of the wilds, <CHARNAME>, and to hear such news of them disturbs me greatly.~
@857  = ~Strange, this man bears hardly a trace of anger for those who placed him here.~
@858  = ~There is nothing righteous about this. It is a twisted perversion of all that humanity existing in nature stand for.~
@859  = ~You have, through your actions, caused many innocent townsfolk to lose their lives. This cannot be permitted to go on.~
@860  = ~You know, Faldorn only did what she saw was right, as did those around her.~
@861  = ~Yes, she did. It leaves me to ponder about the state of my perceptions.~
@862  = ~I might have known that such evils would be perpetrated by such as the djinni for no other purpose other than to provide entertainment.~
@863  = ~It shouldn't be that much of a trouble to hunt down this rakshasa, and it would be pleasure to end such creatures, as well as send these djinni well away from here.~
@864  = ~There is something amiss here, <CHARNAME>. I do not know enough to pinpoint its source, but enough to know that we should be on our guard.~
@865  = ~Wait... is that my beloved Kova Kashiro? How splendid! It is good to know that you are alive and kicking, my dear man.~
@866  = ~If you wish to take me, you are welcome to try.~
@867  = ~Take you? No, certainly not, my old friend. I am thankful enough to see that the rest haven't caught up with you yet.~
@868  = ~I don't quite know what to say, Itona.~
@869  = ~Take your time to think on it, then - I do have some business to settle here first, anyway. Maybe after that we could catch up for old time's sake.~
@870  = ~So, where were we, <CHARNAME>?~
@871  = ~Thank you, my dear <CHARNAME>, for a job well done. I really don't wish you any ill, but I have my own interests to see to. Namely, to enriching myself by almost ten thousand gold.~
@872  = ~I think the Dao would also be pleased with us for Ihtafeer's head. Delightfully fair, I believe.~
@873  = ~I knew I should have put my blade into your back, Itona.~
@874  = ~You expect me to believe you would do so, with all that reluctance of yours to kill anyone unless necessary? I doubt it.~
@875  = ~In any case, its time to catch up, my old friend. Let's see whose knife is the sharper one.~
@876  = ~So, he is dead, is he?~
@877  = ~To think he had been one of the better ones among the thieves, and that we last parted as friends some years ago, drinking to his posting to prosperous Trademeet. I had once looked forward to meeting him again.~
@878  = ~I'm not sure what to say, Kova.~
@879  = ~Gah! Damned be my sentimentality, damned be my goodness! Damned be this weak willed spirit of mine!~
@880  = ~There are better things to do than to mourn over cut-throats. Let us make haste from here.~
@881  = ~He is right, there is no profit by wasting our time on such errands for stuck up pseudo aristocracy that have nothing better to do than to spend a few centuries wrangling over petty lineage.~
@882  = ~That explains quite a bit. It should be best if we do as he says.~
@883  = ~A more elegant solution would be if we simply dropped this whole unnecessary excursion.~
@884  = ~This is a sorry and bloody state of affairs. To think the undead actually protected the living, from themselves.~
@885  = ~Pride brought them to this end, and I feel only pity for them. Would that we had been wiser and less greedy.~
@886  = ~I believe this is the best choice for all concerned, <CHARNAME>, and I respect you for that.~
@887  = ~Even though it really was none of our business in the first place.~
@888  = ~Bah, I thought as much. Yet another snotty noble, one of those with the easy life.~
@889  = ~That may be so, but if evil has come upon her and she needs our aid, then we should provide it.~
@890  = ~Yes, and I really think you shouldn't be seen with us either. I'm more than capable of picking locks anyway, and it wouldn't do to get your hands dirty and your aunty mad with you now, would it?~
@891  = ~How can you say such a thing? But no, I can't expect you to understand, but the leader of your party might. Please, may I go with you? I can pull my own weight.~
@892  = ~I think it's really for the best that she stays out of harm's way. We've been about enough not to get lost in a little keep. Besides, having her run around collecting all her precious little trinkets while we're doing all the fighting doesn't seem a good idea.~
@893  = ~She's courageous enough to want to join us, Kova, so why don't you accept that nobles can also mean well? Let <CHARNAME> make the decision for <PRO_HIMHER>self.~
@894  = ~It is unbecoming to make a joke when someone's life is stake, <CHARNAME>.~
@895  = ~Don't take it too hard now, Daleson, <PRO_HESHE> was just making jest, albeit an ill-timed one.~
@896  = ~Well, that was a very informative conversation. So, nothing much between us and our objective, just thirty or so trolls and an unknown number of yuan-ti, plus some extra pets.~
@897  = ~Is it me or do none of you think that's a tall order?~
@898  = ~It can be done, and will be done, for the sake of what is right.~
@899  = ~You know, Kiyone, much as I mean well and all, I do have a neck to care about.~
@900  = ~So do I, Kova, so do I.~
@901  = ~A counterspell should do the trick.~
@902  = ~It's at times like this when I can fully understand why others would love to stick their dagger into another person's gut and twist the handle slowly. Especially when the gut belongs to a good-for-nothing aristocratic scum.~
@903  = ~You will do no such thing. It is reasonable to be angered, but turning a thought into an action is often all that separates the evil from the good.~
@904  = ~The beast is dead. Though I wonder, who was behind all of this, that it could organise its kind enough to raise such a detestable army.~
@905  = ~Some things, I think, are better left unknown.~
@906  = ~It would be better to find out, that we might face such vileness and put an end to it.~
@907  = ~Exactly what I was afraid of.~
@908  = ~This is a situation that could lead to further complications. Still, I'd rather trust your hand to see to it that the people here are taken care of, rather than place it in the hands of more distasteful nobles.~
@909  = ~What Nalia proposes could be well, especially if it means that the people about here will be able to live a life without oppression. Even if it may mean some inconvenience for us, it could well be worth it.~
@910  = ~This is a situation that could lead to further complications. Still, I'd rather trust our own hands to take see to it that the people here are well taken care of, rather than place in the hands of more distasteful nobles.~
@911  = ~Bah, I hate these places, and the sordid business done in here.~
@912  = ~How so, Kova? It is a legitimate business on its own, bar the presence of slavery in the background. It does also keep shady characters like yourself busy in activities generally less harmful to others.~
@913  = ~I wouldn't deal with harlots - they disgust me.~
@914  = ~Is that so? What a pathetic thief you are, Kova.~
@915  = ~Well, if you haven't whored, have you not a lover or should I suppose you have no libido?~
@916  = ~I...~
@917  = ~There's no need for you to know such, Kiyone. I'm sure it's not a matter worthy of your concern.~
@918  = ~My, my aren't you a sharp one? Amusingly impressive.~
@919  = ~Surely, my lady, you can't actually condone such wretched practices? Nor be impressed by his false claims to purity?~
@920  = ~I condone what I condone. Besides, Anomen, you don't even come close to understanding what we've been saying.~
@921  = ~I had only heard of such but now, to actually see it done, makes my stomach twist with loathing.~
@922  = ~As if slavery were not criminal enough! This is an atrocity that cannot go unpunished!~
@923  = ~I'll put an end to this wickedness. Free them, now!~
@924  = ~I'd advise you to obey, for the sake of your continued health.~
@925  = ~I warned you, fool!  Guards!!  Intruders!!~
@926  = ~Well, don't say I didn't warn you.~
@927  = ~Our names do not matter, you only need to know that we will free you from the dominion of evil.~
@928  = ~Give us the keys to the cells, or face the wrath of righteousness!~
@929  = ~It is no more than what should have been, but which has been unjustly withheld.~
@930  = ~This is a fair deed and pleasing. If only, freedom was all there is.~
@931  = ~It is over, Lehtinan, and I will not allow your vile deeds to go unpunished.~
@932  = ~Rest assured, Hendak, we shall certainly wipe out that nest of vipers.~
@933  = ~I prefer to see it as a mission of rescue.~
@934  = ~See it as you like - justice will be administered where it must.~
@935  = ~We have come to free the slaves kept here. Let us pass or face the consequences.~
@936  = ~I would have loved to cut him down like the dog he is!~
@937  = ~Still, it is clear killing him will get us nowhere. Let us get down to the root of this foulness and strike at the heart of the matter.~
@938  = ~See, what did I tell you about the courts and the Council?~
@939  = ~Then let us act first to rectify their oversights.~
@940  = ~Wretched, accursed slaver! You can yield and the courts shall decide your fate, or resist and be judged by my song of my bowstring.~
@941  = ~Look to your own hide, vile creature! You can yield and the courts shall decide your fate, or resist and be judged by my song of my bowstring.~
@942  = ~If what Hendak said was true, this is one man I'd sooner see dead than before the courts.~
@943  = ~A child in here with these beasts? Death was too kind a fate for that man!~
@944  = ~I know of some ways that might just be suitable, but it's too bad he is now beyond their reach.~
@945  = ~Some gold might help her get back home, but too much would surely attract attention which would see to it that she winds up robbed, dead or in a place of abuse.~
@946  = ~We have done no more than to set things as they should always have been.~
@947  = ~It sits ill with me to kill this creature that has done us no harm and which has only served to comfort this old man in the sewers.~
@948  = ~There doesn't seem to be a reason not to give the sword. If whoever created these illusions in the first place had wanted the beast to be free, it probably wouldn't require us to release it.~
@949  = ~No, this is as it should be. What you've hoped to gain, who you've hoped to kill, is beyond you now, forever. And that's the way it should be.~
@950  = ~Yes, a mage is a criminal and... I suppose can understand how you feel, Kalah, but it doesn't justify the means. Maybe, had things been different, there could have been a way out, before all this.~
@951  = ~You... understand? I... what have I done... No! You don't understand, don't understand anything!~
@952  = ~I am an investigator working for Magistrate Bylanna, and may be able to deal with your problem for you, if you'll just let us know what is going on in here.~
@953  = ~If this is an illusion, I've certainly never seen or heard of one of such a grand scale. Let us be wary.~
@954  = ~There once was a man with a heart true,
raised in shadows yet from them flew.
With much gold on his head,
they want him so dead,
but with his love he'll show them a thing or two.~
@955  = ~Who in the... you know how I can get out of this mess?~
@956  = ~But what is this about love, I definitely don't have any, how exactly can it help me?~
@957  = ~There once was a ranger learned in laws
but inside always saw all in flaws
Her world never true
her work never through
but a wanted soul might be her true cause.~
@958  = ~Who are you? How do you know what you know, and on what basis do you say these things? Speak plainly!~
@959  = ~You seem full of energy and drive, but inside you are a lost soul who is tired and needing a rock to cling to. Set your pride aside, and see that what you do is not just out of duty.~
@960  = ~My, what nonsense you spout. I'm sorry <CHARNAME> was gullible enough to think what you have to say is worth listening to.~
@961  = ~You are pressed on all sides, yet you stake your all on a light you have never seen. Hold fast and don't despair, for you may yet come out a better person, and find the purpose you have never known.~
@962  = ~That was unexpectedly encouraging. I still think I'm going to die but I'll bear these words in mind. If I didn't think it's so much babble I'd probably be more grateful.~
@963  = ~The creature is dead. That is a relief.~
@964  = ~So you weren't actually certain we'd survive the encounter.~
@965  = ~Yes. I am human, Kova.~
@966  = ~Perhaps it might be best if I didn't know that too well.~
@967  = ~Maybe. Probably the best for both of us. Still...~
@968  = ~Let's move on, shall we?~
@969  = ~We're... actually alive. This is a rather unexpected, albeit pleasant surprise.~
@970  = ~We prevailed once before, and we have shown that we can do it again.~
@971  = ~No thank you, not again please. That was a considerably more dangerous than I'd ever care to experience.~
@972  = ~Dangerous yes, and difficult yes, but at least we know we have survived before and can take heart.~
@973  = ~I'd rather take heart in hoping that I won't be having such a harrowing experience again. Still, I doubt that will be the case.~
@974  = ~At least we both agree on that last point.~
@975  = ~Where... where am I? What am I doing here?~
@976  = ~Breathing again. If nothing else, that's an improvement.~
@977  = ~Yes, indeed it is. I died, didn't I?~
@978  = ~Oh, it is you, <CHARNAME>. I died, didn't I?~
@979  = ~It certainly did appear that way.~
@980  = ~So this was death... perhaps I fear it less now. Yet, a more unpleasant experience would be hard to come by, and I'd certainly not care to experience it again.~
@981  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for bringing me back. It is a relief of sorts, to be back among the living.~
@982  = ~I thought I died. What am I doing back here?~
@983  = ~<CHARNAME> brought you back, Kiyone. Are you all right?~
@984  = ~Yes, I am certainly alive. How strange, and unexpected. I suppose I do owe you my thanks, <CHARNAME>, for bringing me back.~
@985  = ~I would appreciate a moment to collect myself. I didn't quite expect to return, and had thought my battle forever ended.~
@986  = ~That would certainly have ended it for me as well.~
@987  = ~But no, there's more to be done, isn't there? Yes, there always tends to be.~
@988  = ~Let us be on our way, then, till the time for a more complete ending for our adventures is reached.~
