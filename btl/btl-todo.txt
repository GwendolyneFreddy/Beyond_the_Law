NOTES from  Austin:
-------------------

1. In the mod there is a file Inter25.tra, in which dialogues with Volo and interjections of the ToB part are added, except for the call through the Fate Spirit, but this file is not compiled in a tp2 file - perhaps it is worth including it there?
2. At the same time, without strings for the Fate Spirit the EET_TRANSITION function will not be needed, so I did not add it.
3. Also, the TP2 file does not compile the riddles.d file (as it has been included under Zyraen's Miscellaneous Mods), and files from the Extras folder (for what reason, I don’t know)

3. "Enhanced Statue of Riddles has been removed, as it has been included under Zyraen’s Miscellany Mod ( https://www.pocketplane.net/zyraens-miscellany )". ;)
